## Types of Coal Mining 
When it comes to mining coal there are two processes by which coal can be removed from the ground: surface mining or underground mining. In Australia the majority of coal mining is done via the opencast method although often the method of choice is dependent on certain characteristics of the coal deposit 1.. The opencast also referred to as the open-pit method is the ideal technique when

## What Are the Four Stages in Coal Formation?
 · Follow Us: The four stages in coal formation are peat lignite bituminous and anthracite. Each of these stages must be completed for coal to form. Stage one in coal production is peat. Peat is a fibrous substance that is oxidized by water and carbon dioxide. When a plant dies and stays under water it builds up an accumulation of peat.

There are four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels beach sands or other environments.

Andrew P. Schissler in Encyclopedia of Energy 2004 2.3 Strip Mining. Strip mining is employed in coal reserves where the overburden is removed in rectangular blocks in plan view called pits or strips. The pits are parallel and adjacent to each other. Strip mining is fundamentally different from contour or area mining on how the overburden is displaced called spoil handling.
