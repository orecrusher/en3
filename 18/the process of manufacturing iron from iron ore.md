HYBRIT is a collaboration between LKAB SSAB and Vattenfall aiming towards a completely fossil-free process for iron- and steelmaking. Instead of coal hydrogen will be used to reduce LKAB's iron ore to iron – the biggest technological shift in iron- and steel production in a 1000 years. Play video. play-solo.

## What Is Involved in the Processing of Iron Ore? (with 
The main goal for the processing of iron ore is to take the ore extracted during the mining effort break the ore into usable units and then purify those units before the actual smelting begins. Doing so makes it easier to produce a higher grade of iron that in turn can be used to create materials for use in everything from manufacturing lawn furniture to cookware to building materials.

To separate iron from iron ore coke (substance when gas is taken out of coal) limestone and dolomite are charged into the blast furnace. Temperature raised to 1600oF. This high temp causes the coke to burn and melt the iron. This red hot iron drained at an opening at the base of the furnace.
