## Directional Drilling: Everything You Ever Wanted To Know 
 · Directional drilling is a broad term used to describe any boring that doesn't go in a straight line vertically down. In fact even in a vertical well it might be necessary to deviate to avoid a geological formation or a previous stuck pipe then return to the original path. In this instance the driller uses sidetracking techniques.
