To use coal both fuel cell and gas turbine systems depend on coal gasifiion technology; both can accept methane and light hydrocarbons in the fuel gas. As discussed in Chapter 6 coal gasifiion results in a loss of five to 10 percentage points in overall power generation efficiency compared to natural gas.
