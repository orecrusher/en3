 · Bentonite hydrochar composites (BTHC) reduce NH 3 volatilization by 33.5 kg N ha −1.. BTHC reduces NH 4 + loss in floodwater and improved soil NH 4 + retention.. BTHC improves the rice yield by 18.8% and plant N use efficiency by 37.4%. • Mitigated NH 3 volatilization by BTHC might contribute to the increase of rice yield.
