Power Generation from Coal Measuring and Reporting Efficiency Performance and CO 2 Emissions Coal is the biggest single source of energy for electricity production and its share is growing. The efficiency of converting coal into electricity matters: more efficient power plants use less fuel and emit less climate-damaging carbon dioxide.

## How dangerous is coal? – Jean
A coal fired power plant with a yield of 33% (which is the world average for these plants) will use roughly 400 kg of coal to produce one electric MWh. If ashes represent 20% of the incoming weight we will get roughly 80 kg of ashes. 1 TWh électrique (one million MWh or one billion kWh) means 400000 tonnes of coal used and 80000 tonnes of ashes at the end.

## 10 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
To date DOE has not adopted environmental emission goals for coal liquefaction process plants as it has for electric power plants. Future plants will likely have to meet air land and water emission requirements that are more stringent than those in place today which could increase the overall cost of coal conversion processes relative to processes that use oil or gas.
