## Types of Rock Crushers 
Cone crushers are built with a rotating mantle in a concave bowl lined with manganese—this is similar to gyratory crushers but the crushing chamber in cone crushers is not as steeply angled. Cone crushers can accept medium-hard to very hard and abrasive feeds that might be dry or wet though not sticky (whereas gyratory crushers are better at handling softer dryer feeds).

## Cone Crusher 
Cone crushers were originally designed and developed by around 1920 and therefore are often described as cone crushers. As the mechanisms of crushing in these crushers are similar to gyratory crushers their designs are similar but in this case the spindle is supported at the bottom of the gyrating cone instead of being suspended as in larger gyratory crushers.
