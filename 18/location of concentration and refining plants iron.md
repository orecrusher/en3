 · IRON UPTAKE BY PLANTS. Plants uptake iron in its oxidized forms Fe 2 + (ferrous form) or Fe 3+ (ferric form). Plants use various iron uptake mechanisms. One of these is the chelation mechanism – the plant releases compounds called siderophores which bind iron and enhance its solubility. This mechanism also involves bacteria.

## 23.2: Principles of Extractive Metallurgy 
 · Refining a metal can be accomplished by electrolysis or zone refining. Certain ores such as those of copper and titanium require special treatment before they can be refined. The extraction of iron ore is particularly important for commercial uses because of the mass production of its alloy steel.
