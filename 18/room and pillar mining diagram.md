## What Is a Room and Pillar? (with picture) 
Room and pillar mining may also be known as bord and pillar mining in some areas. Throughout history miners have used a random room and pillar mining strategy to extract minerals from the earth. Workers would simply mine in certain areas and leave other areas intact with little planning or reason involved in the process.

Room and Pillar mining : Room and pillar mining is commonly done in flat or gently dipping bedded ore bodies. Pillars are left in place in a regular pattern while the rooms are mined out. In many room and pillar mines the pillars are taken out starting at the farthest point from the stope access allowing the roof to collapse and fill in the stope.
