## Patearoa gold: Alluvial 
 · The gold at Patearoa has been concentrated in gravel deposits (=alluvial gold) that accumulated in alluvial fans on the slopes of the actively rising Rock and Pillar Range. The on-going uplift over the past million years caused erosion of early-formed gravels and the gold has been recycled into progressively younger gravel deposits and into modern streams.

All these areas are historic gold mining areas and alluvial gold is still commonly found. The concentration of gold does not justify commercial mining today. However as discussed already the ability to recover 100% of the gold you recover combined with the high prices of gold today can make it a viable prospect for the hobby gold miner to make more than pocket money in his or her spare time.

In the Otago most of the Gold is Alluvial Gold - that is Gold is contained in alluvial gravels deposited by the action of water and ice. The gravel does not need to be crushed and the separation is by various techniques of "washing" to separate the Gold which is very dense (density 19) from the much less dense rocks and sand.

The alluvial gold industry of New Zealand is based on the placer deposits in Otago and on the West Coast. Production from these since discovery in the 1850s has been an estimated 480 t (15 Moz) of gold. Annual output has expanded continuously since 1980 and is expected to be over 2 t of gold for 1989.
