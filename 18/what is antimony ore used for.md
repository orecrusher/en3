## Antimony Market 
Antimony is fused with lead and the resulting alloy (solid solution) is used in lead-acid batteries. However environmental regulations on lead emissions have restricted the consumption of antimony in lead batteries globally. Other alloys incorporating the element are used to make bullets cable sheaths solder and even organ pipes.

## antimony 
Antimony is often found in other ores as well e.g. silver copper and lead. The pure element antimony is produced from the ore by roasting it to form the oxide then reducing the oxide with carbon or iron; often a flux of sodium sulfate or sodium carbonate is used to prevent loss of molten antimony
