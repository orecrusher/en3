## What Are The Differences Between Single And Double Toggle 
 · The crushing process happens when the feed material between the two jaws is compressed. Another difference between the double toggle jaw crushers and the single ones is the position of the eccentric. In a double jaw crusher the eccentric is found behind the swinging jaw. That helps protect the eccentric from any further damages.
