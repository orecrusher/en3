## Microstructure and Minerals Evolution of Iron Ore Sinter 
SiO2 and Al2O3 are two important minerals that can affect the mechanical and metallurgical properties of sinter. This investigation systematically studied the influences of these minerals and revealed their functional mechanisms on sinter quality. Results showed that with an increasing Al2O3 content in sinter the sintering indexes presented an improvement before the content exceeded 1.80%

It almost always consists of iron oxides the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (Fe2O3). It's a major ingredient in steel.

In the DRI process iron ore in the form of lump or pellets is reduced to metallic iron in the solid state unlike in the BF where the material is melted. Today about 100 Mt of DRI is produced globally each year with the majority of that using reformed natural gas (essentially splitting natural gas into hydrogen and carbon monoxide) to strip away the oxygen from the iron ore.

## How Scientists Use XRD to Analyze Minerals
 · The only source of primary iron is iron ore but before all that iron ore can be turned into steel it must go through the sintering process. Sinter is created by mixing iron ore concentrate with several additives such as limestone and silica to control the chemistry and then igniting it at 1200°C in a continuous belt-fed furnace.

## Iron Ore 
Sintering of iron ore with returned sinter fines and plant dusts is a commonly used pretreatment approach in BF ironmaking. Other sinter constituents include up to 3–5 wt% coke breeze to provide fuel and heat in situ and dolomite limestone and silica fluxes for forming suitable agglomerates with appropriate compositions.

## How a Steel Plant Used Sinter Feed Analysis to Get More 
 · Sinter quality begins with the mined iron ore and the proper selection and mixing of the raw materials. Inhomogeneous raw mix can affect permeability and cause an increase in fuel consumption. That's why it is important that the material be analyzed to determine the elemental composition of the bulk raw materials in sinter feed.

## Blast Furnace Anatomy #1 – To the Heart of Steelworks 
 · First the iron ore the raw materials for steel comes from the Earth. Most iron ores — hematite magnetite limonite — contain an average of 60% of iron (Fe). Before the iron ores enter a blast furnace it undergoes 'sintering' which turns the pristine iron ore into more compact and appropriate sizes.
