 · The unmelted iron ores still contain non-reduced iron oxides. An unfavourable accumulation of ores at the contact points can also make gas flow difficult and thus leave non-reduced iron ore behind. At the latest however when the melting process occurs in the deeper and hotter zones of the blast furnace iron ores can be almost completely reduced.

In the integrated steelmaking route iron ore containing ferrous oxides is converted to metallic iron inside the blast furnace via a chemical process called 'reduction'. Coal in the form of metallurgical coal and pulverised coal act as the active agents or 'reductants' that strip away oxygen from the iron ore to yield metallic iron.
