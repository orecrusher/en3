## Iron Ore Mining 
Iron ores are rocks and mineral deposits from which clanging iron can be reasonably extracted. The ores are generally prosperous in iron oxides and fluctuate in color ranging from dark grey bright yellow deep purple to even rusty red. The iron by its own is usually found in the structure of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) hematite (Fe 2 O 3) goethite

## Extraction of Iron 
 · It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs. The extraction of iron from its ore is a long and subdued process that helps in separating the useful components from the waste materials such as slag. What happens in the Blast Furnace? The purpose of a Blast Furnace is to reduce the concentrated ore chemically to its liquid metal state.
