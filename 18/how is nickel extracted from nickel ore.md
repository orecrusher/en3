## How Is Nickel Extracted From Nickel Ore
Nickel Mining Nickel Mines Nickel Mine Copper. The mining methods differ with respect to the type of ore being mined.Since nickel is composed in two types of ores both of them are mined differently.The sulfide ores are mined using underground mining methods though open-pit mining can also be done in early stages.The laterite ores are mined through applying earth-moving operation techniques.

## Processing of Nickel Laterite Ores on the Rise
Traditionally nickel has been processed from sulfide ores in an approach similar to copper processing in which the ore is upgraded to concentrates and then smelted. As sulfide ore resources dwindle however processing of lateritic nickel ores is becoming of greater necessity with many recognizing nickel laterite ores as the future of the nickel industry.
