The function of compounding moulding extrusion and vulcanisation are similar to that of the process explained for rubber products. Compounding is a dispersion process which is done using a dispersion mill (ball mill attritor mill etc). Dipping is done to give a shape to the product in a former (mould) as per the end product specifiion.
