## Figure 9 from Real
Cone crushers are used in the mineral mining and aggregate industry for fragmentation and production of rock materials. Cone crusher control systems are widely used for machine protection wear compensation and to some extent increasing production. These systems ordinarily focus on the crusher and not the yield of production process.

Cone crushers were originally designed and developed by around 1920 and therefore are often described as cone crushers. As the mechanisms of crushing in these crushers are similar to gyratory crushers their designs are similar but in this case the spindle is supported at the bottom of the gyrating cone instead of being suspended as in larger gyratory crushers.

The chief difference between cone and gyratory or jaw crushers is the nearly parallel arrangement of the mantle and the cone at the discharge end in the cone crusher. This is illustrated in Figure 5.2. Reduction ratios in the following ranges are common for cone crushers: 6:1 - 8:1 for secondaries 4:1 - 6:1 for tertiary and quaternary crushing.
