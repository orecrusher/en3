## Retarders 
Retarders. A retarder is an admixture that slows down the chemical process of hydration so that the concrete remain plastic and workable for a longer time than concrete without retarder.The retarders are used in casting and compacting or consolidating a large number of pours without formation of cold joints.

## What is Gypsum? 
 · Gypsum has ability to retard the spread of fire. Hence it can give the fire protection up to two hours. It is flexible in nature. Also it is easy to work with as any wood based products. It is light in weight and hence offer economy in structural costs and transportation. Gypsum provides smooth surface. It is a non-resonant material.
