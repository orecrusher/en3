## Germany's three lignite mining regions 
 · Germany has been the largest lignite producer in the world since the beginning of industrial lignite mining. It still is followed by China Russia and the United States. The softer and moister lignite (also called brown or soft coal) has a lower calorific value than hard coal and can only be mined in opencast operations. When burned it is more CO2 intensive than hard coal.

Around 90% of lignite is used to generate electricity and district heating in public and industrial power plants. It therefore accounted for 22.5% of electricity generation in Germany in 2017. Due to lignite's specific properties open-pit mines and power plants work together in order to exploit it commercially close to where deposits are found.

The deposits of lignite in the Lusatian mining district originated about 17 million years ago in locally different form. Characteristic is the horizontal orientation of the so-called lignite seams. We primarily extract the 2nd Lusatian lignite seam in opencast mines at a depth of about 60 to 120 metres.
