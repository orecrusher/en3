The flotation process in general does not float free gold particles but is particularly effective when gold is associated with sulfide minerals such as pyrites. In a typical pyrytic gold ore the gold is encapsulated within an iron sulfide crystal structure. Highly oxidized ores generally do not respond well to flotation.

## Froth Flotation of Iron Ores
 · With the depleting reserves of high-grade iron ore in the world froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate- and low-grade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market. In over half a century's practice in the iron ore industry froth flotation has been established as an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore.
