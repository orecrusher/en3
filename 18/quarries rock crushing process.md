## Dust emission from crushing of hard rock aggregates 
Â Â· In quarries applying secondary crushing Quarry 3 processing limestone dust emission was approximately 50% lower compared to other quarries processing granitic rock material. This result is incoherent with the conclusion drawn by EPA (2004) stating that the rock type is no major variable for dust emissions at aggregate quarries.

## Quarrying 
Quarrying involves the fracture of large fragments from rock beds largely due to the process of discontinuous rock-mass failure. Preglacial weathering can also weaken rocks and assists the quarrying process. Additionally freeze-thaw processes may be active beneath glacier margins where heat can be evacuated from the bed.

## Extraction of Aggregates Process 
Rock quarries usually operate for at least 30 years and are developed in distinct benches or steps. A controlled explosion is normally used to release the rock from the working face. It is then transported by truck or conveyor to a crusher where it goes through a series of crushing and screening stages to produce a range of final sizes to suit customers' needs.
