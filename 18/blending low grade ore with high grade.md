 · High-grade gold contained in narrow veins that snake through the rock can only be mined by excavating shafts and hoisting the ore to surface via low tunnels (drifts). This process is expensive because digging deep requires a lot of material to be removed around the veins so that the mining equipment can access them.

## Iron Ore 
Low-grade ore. Low-grade ore is a term applied to iron-rich rocks with cut-off grades in the range of 25ï¿½30% Fe. It was the main supply of iron ore for many centuries of the World's early history of production of iron. Since the 1950s North America's main supply has been low-grade ore.

## Gold grade 
The grade of mined raw gold ore is measured in grams of gold per tonne of ore. High grade gold ore contains more gold per tonne; this means that more gold is obtained from every tonne mined. This greatly increases the profitability of a mine. Indeed the high cost of processing extremely low grade ore may actually make mining financially

## Extracting from low grade ores 
Extract copper and gold from low-grade ores more efficiently. Ore deposits are becoming increasingly complex to treat and grades continue to deteriorate in known reserves. For instance approximately 15-20 per cent of the world's current gold production involves refractory ores that must be pre-treated prior to downstream recovery by cyanidation.

Magnetite concentrate is typically high in Fe grade and releases heat when oxidised. Hence it is an ideal sweetener to maintain sinter grade and quality when high proportions of low grade ores are used in the blends. However often magnetite concentrate is very fine and more costly. It is therefore important to develop strategies for its effective utilisation to improve the sinter quality while
