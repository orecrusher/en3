Serpentina plants are very easy grow. Just make sure the plant gets sunlight for 3-4 hours and that the leaves and soil are watered daily. Serpentina bears a pod that contains tiny seeds which pop and grow anywhere where there is soil - even cemented fences and floors with holes! Serpentina plants for sale are available in our garden.

## Structure of Rauvolfia serpentina Strictosidine Synthase 
 · Abstract. The enzyme strictosidine synthase (STR1) from the Indian medicinal plant Rauvolfia serpentina is of primary importance for the biosynthetic pathway of the indole alkaloid ajmaline. Moreover STR1 initiates all biosynthetic pathways leading to the entire monoterpenoid indole alkaloid family representing an enormous structural variety of ∼2000 compounds in higher plants.
