the size of the leaching plant that would be required as well as reduces the amount of leaching reagents required. Many gold plants use conventional thickening with flocculant addition. High rate thickeners as well as de-watering systems that use cyclones only or cyclones and high-rate thickeners can also be used in principle.

## What is Lithium Extraction and How Does It Work?
 · Facilities usually operate several large evaporation ponds of various ages and may extract other metals (e.g. potassium) from younger ponds while waiting for the lithium content to reach a concentration optimal for further processing. In some cases reverse osmosis (RO) is used to concentrate the lithium brine to speed up the evaporation process.
