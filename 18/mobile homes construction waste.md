## Construction Waste: The Hidden Cost of Building a Home 
Back to the hidden cost of construction waste. When that hidden cost is removed your budget stretches much farther. On average you can expect a modular home to cost about 15% less than the same floorplan built in a traditional manner. The reason for this is that building in a controlled factory environment means less construction waste.

## What Is Modular Construction? 
Less Material Waste: When building in a factory waste is eliminated by recycling materials controlling inventory and protecting building materials. Improved Air Quality: Because the modular structure is substantially completed in a factory-controlled setting using dry materials the potential for high levels of moisture being trapped in the new construction is eliminated.
