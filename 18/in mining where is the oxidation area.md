## Pollution from Mining 
Mining provides essential raw materials for an industrialized society. However it causes serious pollution of surface and groundwater. Transferring minerals from deep below the surface to the surface promotes oxidation reactions. Oxidation of iron salts and of sulfur-containing materials in the presence of water leads to highly acidic solutions.
