## Metals and Non
Ores: The minerals from which a metal can be profitably extracted are called ores. Metals found at the bottom of reactivity series are least reactive and they are often found in nature in free-state; such as gold silver copper etc. Copper and silver are also found in the form of sulphide and oxide ores.

 · Silver tarnishes in air to form a black coating of silver sulphide which has the formula Ag 2 S. The chemical equation for the formation of silver tarnish following reaction with hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) is as follows:. 2 Ag (s) + H 2 S (g) → Ag 2 S (s) + H 2(g). There's speculation that in the present day tarnishing of silver actually occurs more quickly due to the increased amounts
