ABSTRACT: "Mountaintop mining is the dominant form of coal mining and the largest driver of land cover change in the central Appalachians. The waste rock from these surface mines is disposed of in the adjacent river valleys leading to a burial of headwater streams and dramatic increases in salinity and trace metal concentrations immediately downstream.
