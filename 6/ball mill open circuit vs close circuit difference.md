## What is Open Circuit Voltage? 
Open circuit voltage (or potential) is voltage which is not connected to any load in a circuit. See the two examples below to see the difference between open circuit voltage with a voltage source which is in a closed circuit and connected to a load. As you can see open circuit voltage is disconnected and does not form a complete circuit.

## Open
Open-circuit voltage (abbreviated as OCV or V OC) is the difference of electrical potential between two terminals of a device when disconnected from any circuit. There is no external load connected. No external electric current flows between the terminals. Alternatively the open-circuit voltage may be thought of as the voltage that must be applied to a solar cell or a battery to stop the current.

Let's consider a circuit diagram with open and closed switch. When we close the switch the bulb glows. Now let's consider a circuit with Voltmeter Ammeter and a Resistor. It looks like.

## The Basics of Thermocouples 
 · If you use thermocouples you must insert a measurement device in the loop to acquire information about the temperature difference between the hot and cold junctions. Figure 1b shows a typical setup. The thermocouple wires are brought to a terminal block and an electric circuit measures the open circuit voltage.
