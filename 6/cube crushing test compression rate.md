## What is Compression Testing? 
Compression testing is one of the most fundamental types of mechanical testing alongside tensile and flexion tests. Compression tests are used to determine a material's behavior under applied crushing loads and are typically conducted by applying compressive pressure to a test specimen (usually of either a cuboid or cylindrical geometry) using platens or specialized fixtures on a universal

 · Assuming crush dates are scheduled every 7 days if for example your cube reaches strength on day 8 the test will show a slab that has not reached strength. As a result permission to strike will not be granted until the next strike date day 14 creating a large gap of time where you could be progressing your programme.

## Compressive strength 
The compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence for this region = where this time E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.

 · Compressive strength of 100mm cube is greater than the compressive strength of 150mm. The reason is that.. 1) If we mould concrete into cube having a small demension like 100 X 100 X 100 mm^3 the bonding is very good than the 150 mm^3 cube. we know that as the size of the cube or beam increasing the void spaces in it also increases.

## What is the compressive strength of mortar
If you mean mortar used for masonry the answer is "not much" (answering in as much detail as the question allows). Some M1 class mortar cubes I tested a couple of days ago were only around 0.5MPa. M2 might be a few MPa. Mortar strength has a rela

## Compressive Strength of Mortar 
Compressive Strength of Mortar -Mix Ratio and Cube Test. Compressive strength of mortar is determined by using 2 inch or 50mm cubes as per ASTM C109 / C109M - Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of Hydraulic Cement Mortars. Mortar is a combination of cement sand mixed with water. It is used for masonry works such as brick masonry and
