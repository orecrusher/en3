Free-milling gold ores are defined as an ore from which standard cyanidation (which takes about 20-30 hours) can extract more than 90 % of the gold under the condition that the ore size is 80 % < 75 µm (Joe Zhou 2004). Complex ores meanwhile require significantly higher cyanide or oxygen levels to attain an economic recovery (Brooy 1994).

## Gold Refining 
 · In cyanidation metallic gold is oxidised and dissolved in an alkaline cyanide solution. When gold dissolution is complete the gold-bearing solution is separated from the solids. With ores of higher gold content (greater than 20 grams of gold per tonne of ore) cyanidation is accomplished by vat leaching which involves holding a slurry of ore and solvent in large tanks equipped with agitators.
