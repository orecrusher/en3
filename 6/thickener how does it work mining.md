## What is the Sludge Thickening Process in Water Treatment 
 · Gravity thickening involves using specially designed circular tanks that concentrate thin sludges to a more-dense sludge product. The limitation of this form of clarifiion water treatment is that it works mostly for the excess watery sludge derived from an activated-sludge process. Thickening tanks have slow-moving vertical paddles.

## Thickeners 
Thickeners. The separation of solids from a liquid by gravity sedimentation has traces to the early days of civilization. The normal practice at those times was to use jars or pits mainly for the clarifiion of extracted liquids such as wine or olive oil from contaminating insoluble matter. These batch processes required four separate steps:

How does a gravity thickener work? Gravity thickening uses the natural tendency of higher-density solids to settle out of liquid to concentrate the solids. The solids settle to the bottom of the tank by gravity and the scrapers slowly move the settled thickened solids to a discharge pipe at the bottom of the tank.

The gluten reduces the thickening power of flour. One tablespoon of cornstarch thickens one cup (250 mL) of liquid to a medium consistency. It takes two tablespoons of flour—twice as much—to thicken the same amount of liquid. Your query really brings up the point that there's a lot to learn about the thickeners that cooks use every day.
