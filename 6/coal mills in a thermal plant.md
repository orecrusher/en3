 · A higher Hardgrove index indies the coal is easier to grind. 50 HGI normally is taken for calculating the base capacity of the mill. When coal with HGI higher than 50 is fed to the pulverizer the output will be higher than base capacity and below 50 HGI the output will be lower. The total moisture in coal has a high effect on mill output.
