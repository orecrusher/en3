## [SOLVED] Question 4What is sieving Where is it used 
Sieving allows fine particles to pass through the holes of the sieve while the bigger impurities remain on the sieve. Sieving is used in flour mills to separate broken particles of grains from flour. It is also used at construction sites to separate lumps smaller stones from the mixture of sand and cement.

## Sieve analysis 
A sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used in civil engineering and chemical engineering to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material by allowing the material to pass through a series of sieves of progressively smaller mesh size and weighing the amount of material that is stopped by each sieve as a fraction of the whole mass.
