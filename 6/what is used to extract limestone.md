## use of limestone in iron extraction 
Extraction of Metals Extraction of Iron Iron is extracted from its ore in the blast furnace The main iron ore is called haematite Haematite is iron(III) oxide - Fe 2 O 3 The iron ore contains impurities mainly silica (silicon dioxide) Limestone (calcium carbonate) is added to the iron ore which reacts with the silica to form molten calcium silie in the blast furnace.
