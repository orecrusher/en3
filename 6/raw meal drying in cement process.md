## Inprocess Moisture Measurement 
Risk of contamination originating from raw materials packaging materials or the manufacturing process itself must be eliminated - very very important in food processing. Inprocess microwave moisture sensors are an ideal solution for continuous moisture measurement in the manufacture of food powders like dry milk egg powder and baby formula powder.

 · In a sense raw materials used in concrete are just like the food we eat: They should be of good quality they must be stored and handled properly and they must not be contaminated. The old adage "You are what you eat" comes to mind because the quality of raw materials going into a concrete mix has a direct effect on how the final product will turn out – in both fresh and hardened states.
