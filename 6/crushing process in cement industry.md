## Cement Manufacturing Process 
Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium) sand and clay (silicon aluminum iron) shale fly ash mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

## Cement Industry 
 · Double Shaft Hammer Crushers are used in the cement industry to solve crushing problems in difficult materials like wet limestone combined with clay. This capability to operate under such severe conditions without clogging problems is achieved by the self-cleaning effect of this machine which results from the fact that the material is mainly in contact with rotating elements.
