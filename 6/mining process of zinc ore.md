6.1 Process Overview 6.1.1 Lead and Zinc Ore Mining Lead and zinc ore is nearly always mined below the surface of the ground. Some veins of ore lie as deep as several thousand feet but most deposits lie close to the surface. Lead and zinc ore is mined almost exclusively in underground operations though a few surface operations do exist.

## Zinc Production: From Ore to Metal 
Zinc ores contain 5-15% zinc. To concentrate the ore it is first crushed and then ground to enable optimal separation from the other minerals. Typically a zinc concentrate contains about 55% of zinc with some copper lead and iron. Zinc concentration is usually done at the mine site to keep transport costs to smelters as low as possible.
