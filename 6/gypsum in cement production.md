## What is Gypsum Cement? (with pictures) 
In the manufacturing of gypsum cement raw gypsum is mined from the earth and burned at an extremely high temperature to remove all traces of water. It is then ground to a very fine powder and mixed with alum to speed up the drying process. When water is added to this powder mixture pure gypsum cement is produced.

## [Solved] What is the function of gypsum in cement?
Gypsum slows down the setting time of cement. Gypsum chemical formula CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O. It is a crystalline mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate. Gypsum helps in controlling the rate of hardening of the cement. It also prevents early hardening allowing long working time hence we can say that it helps in the rapid setting of cement.
