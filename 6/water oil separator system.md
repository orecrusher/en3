## Oil/water separators 
Our separators don't use gravity pre-separation so there's no separate oil container. The system also means that there's less time for bacteria to breed in the separator – and it makes servicing cleaner and quicker. We don't use carbon filters – ours are lightweight dust-free and last twice as long.

## Oil Water Separators 
Oil water separators (coalescing plate separators) are enhanced gravity systems required to remove oils and solids from water. Commonly used in vehicle wash bays and mechanical workshops oily water is pumped through to an inlet chamber where solids settle out and oil immediately rises to the surface. After the oily water is separated an oil baffle prevents it from entering the outlet weir.
