## Michigan's Massive Copper Boulders 
 · Michigan's Massive Copper Boulders. In the early 17th century fur traders traversing Lake Superior in North America heard tales of a fabulous boulder lying on the banks of the Ontonagon River. The boulder was said to be five tones in weight and as large as a house. And it was made of solid copper.

## How do you calculate mass using density and volume? 
 · Density is the mass per unit of volume of a substance. The density equation is: "Density" = "Mass"/"Volume" To solve the equation for Mass rearrange the equation by multiplying both sides times Volume in order to isolate Mass then plug in your known values (Density and Volume). Then solve for Mass. "Mass" = "Density x Volume" Example The density of copper is "8.933 g/cm"^3.
