## How Is The Ore Processed In Tin 
Tin Ore Mining ProcessThe density of tin ore is larger than the paragenetic mineral so the mining process of tin ore apply gravity separation. However all kinds of Iron oxides exist in those ore like magnetite hematite etc. which cannot be well separated by using gravity or flotation separation.

## Extractive Metallurgy 
The most common hydrometallurgical process is leaching which involves dissolution of the valuable metals into the aqueous solution. After the solution is separated from the ore solids the solution is often subjected to various processes of purifiion and concentration before the valuable metal is recovered either in its metallic state or as a chemical compound.
