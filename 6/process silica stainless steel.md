## Stainless Steel 
 · Stainless steel grade 430 is capable of resisting oxidation up to 870°C (1598°F) in intermittent usage and up to 815°C (1499°F) in continuous usage. At room temperature it has the tendency to become brittle especially when it has been heated for a long time in the °C (°F) range. This issue can be overcome with annealing.
