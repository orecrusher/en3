## Tire 
Etymology and spelling. The word tire is a short form of attire from the idea that a wheel with a tire is a dressed wheel.. The spelling tyre does not appear until the 1840s when the English began shrink fitting railway car wheels with malleable iron. Nevertheless traditional publishers continued using tire.The Times newspaper in Britain was still using tire as late as 1905.

"Crack density is measured by looking at a 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the road or parking lot that best represents the average condition of the entire pavement" Shapiro said. "Then measure the linear feet of cracks within the 100-square-foot area. The number of linear feet divided by 100 is the crack density."

## Existing Surface Preparation for Overlays – Pavement 
Overlays (either structural or non-structural) make up a large portion of the roadway paving done today.The degree of surface preparation for an overlay is dependent on the condition and type of the existing pavement. Generally the existing pavement should be structurally sound level clean and capable of bonding to the overlay.

## The benefits of modified asphalts 
Highway agencies have recognized the benefits of using modified asphalts to reduce the amount and severity of pavement distresses and to increase service life. The primary benefit of using these high-performance asphalts is improved rutting resistance with less thermal (cold-temperature) cracking and overall improved mixture durability being secondary benefits.
