The steelmaking slag that was obtained in lumps form was crushed with hammer and finally pulverized using Denver laboratory ball mill. The particle from the process was sieved with sieve shaker 16155 Model into 75 106 and 300 µm sieve sizes. XRD was carried out with Fluxana-HD Elektonik Vulcan Fusion Technology.

## When To Use Crushed Stone As Opposed To Gravel For A Project
Crushed stone is a versatile material and can also be used for many commercial residential and DIY projects. Due to its modest cost and easy installation it is often used for horse riding arenas (screenings) and walking and bike paths (screenings and 3/8" size) as well as for drainage systems and as a base or sub-base for residential crushed rock driveways and retaining walls.
