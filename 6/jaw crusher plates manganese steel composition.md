## Manganese steel wear liners — SRP
Austenitic manganese steel – steel alloyed with more than 10% manganese – is work-hardening. That means that high impacts – like those in a crushing chamber for example – cause the formation of a extremely hard surface layer that is two to three times harder than the rest of the alloy If impacted enough this results in a hard exterior layer backed by a softer core.

 · Manganese Steel Chemical Composition. Most steels contain 0.15 to 0.8% manganese. High-strength alloys often contain 1 to 1.8% manganese. At about 1.5% manganese content the steel becomes brittle and this trait increases until about 4 to 5% manganese content is reached. At this point the steel will pulverize at the strike of a hammer.
