Golden Mile ore is unique with most of the gold intriely bound in various sulphide minerals such as pyrite. Roasting is still the most efficient and cost effective way to maximise gold recovery from sulphides however this process has become more restricted due to environmental constraints associated with the atmospheric stack emissions of SO2 and mercury (Hg).

## Roasting of Gold Ore in the Circulating Fluidized
 · Abstract. Gold roasting is a process applicable to refractory ores and concentrates that contain sulfide sulfur organic carbon and potentially arsenic. Removal of these compounds is necessary to achieve high gold recovery (>90%) during cyanide leaching. Gold roasting is typically a metallurgical fluidized bed process.

such as roasting pressure leaching or bacterial leaching. The adverse effect of graphitic carbon can also be overcome by roasting the ore or concentrate to burn off the carbon. All of these techniques are relatively expensive however so the economic cut-off gold grade for refractory ores is somewhat higher than non-refractory ores.

## Method for roasting sulphide ores 
 · In roasting and subsequent gold leaching the roasting temperature should be selected so that no sintering of the particles occurs but rather the roasting material becomes porous and easy to leach. The roasting temperature for roasting sulphides for subsequent leaching should be below the lowest sintering temperature that may occur in the particle but above the sulphating temperature of iron.
