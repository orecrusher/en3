## Rail Track Ballast 
Rail track ballast serves as a bed for rail tracks and provides drainage and strength for heavy loads carried by trains. Ballast is the description for the aggregate beneath the rail track. The track ballast forms the track bed that suports the rail track load and provides water drainage. Rail ballast aggregate is typically 30-50mm aggretate.

## Aggregates » Railway Recycling
 · Network Rail receives over 1m tonnes of spent track ballast at our Aggregate Handling Depots per annum. This means we have a lot of aggregate for sale. The majority of this material is recycled through screening crushing and washing processes that make it suitable for re-use in both rail network projects DIY projects and the construction industry as a whole.
