## Ochre Use in the Middle Stone Age 
The use of ochre in the past has proven valuable for interpreting not only cognitive capabilities of its users but also for its potential to shed light on behavioral and social factors. The late Pleistocene and specifically the Middle Stone Age in southern Africa is a time of significant behavioral and cognitive advances for Homo sapiens—this coincides with the habitual use of ochre.
