## Manganese Ore Processing 
 · Manganese is a critical mineral in America and the development of new methods of beneficiation is highly desirable for our national defenses. While much investigational work has been carried out by the U.S. Bureau of Mines and others there is still a need for more efficient reagents to make many ores economically amenable to the flotation process.

99% manganese has been extracted. It is concluded that high grade manganese can be obtained using nitric acid instead of sulphuric acid [4]. Kelong et al. re-ported that using sawdust and rice husk as reductant in sulphuric acid medium 95% manganese can be leached out. The influencing factors included pyrolusite

## Bog Manganese Ore: A Resource for High Manganese Steel 
 · The ore contains around 23% Mn and 28% Fe with around 7% of combined alumina and silica. Such Mn ore has not found any use because of its sub-grade nature and high iron content and is hence considered as waste. The ore does not respond to any physical beneficiation techniques because of the combined state of the manganese and iron phases.
