## Ball Mills 
8.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1–1.5 times the shell diameter ( Figure 8.11). The feed can be dry with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating or slurry containing 20–40% water by weight.
