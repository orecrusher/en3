Tufa is a variety of limestone formed when carbonate minerals precipitate out of ambient temperature water. Geothermally heated hot springs sometimes produce similar (but less porous) carbonate deposits which are known as travertine.Tufa is sometimes referred to as (meteogene) travertine. It should not be confused with hot spring (thermogene) travertine.
