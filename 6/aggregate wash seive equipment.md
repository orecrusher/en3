## Sieve Analysis 
 · Sieve analysis is a technique used for determining the size of particles in essential distributions such as the number of different size particles are responsible for the surface reaction solubility and flowability. For dry non-agglomerated particles sieve analysis remains a cost-effective and precise measuring instrument. Separating particles by size is called sieving.
