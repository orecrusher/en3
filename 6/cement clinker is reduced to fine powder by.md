Very fine grinding produces a fine powder known as raw meal which is preheated and then sent to the kiln. The material is heated to 1500°C before being suddenly and dramatically cooled by bursts of air. This produces clinker the basic material required for the production of all cements. Clinker is the main ingredient in cement.
