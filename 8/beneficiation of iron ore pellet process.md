## beneficiation of iron ore pellet process
Iron ore can be upgraded to a higher iron ore content through beneficiation. This process generates iron ore filter cake which needs to be pelletized to be used in the steel making process. Also during the processing of high grade iron ores which don't need beneficiated fines which are generated can be pelletized and used instead of being disposed of.
