## A Practical Method of Modelling and Simulation for Ball 
The spherical cutting edge on the ball end mill directly affects its cutting performance. This paper presents a practical method for end mill rake/clearance face modelling. The rake face is a developed ruled surface to fulfill the desired normal rake angle. Revolution surface of the bottom curve on the rake face avoids the interference between the wheel with the designed rake face while grinding.

Simulation and assessment of diamond mill grinding wheel. The test results indie that the surface of grind wheel is of non-Gaussian nature Consequently a non-Gaussian statistical model was proposed to simulate the mill grinding wheel topography Simultaneously some parameters of "Birmingham 14" were introduced to assess the grinding wheel surface quantitatively.
