## Capping Layer 
Capping layer materials help to reduce costs and to protect the subgrade from rainfall and weathering. In road construction the disruption caused by wet weather can be reduced significantly by using readily available locally sourced capping materials. A capping layer is required when the pavement is to be constructed on subgrade with CBR <5%.
