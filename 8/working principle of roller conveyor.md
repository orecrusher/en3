## Screw conveyor working principle/technical parameters 
 · Working Principle. When the screw shaft is rotating due to the gravity of the material and the friction between the materials and the wall it makes the material moving forward along the conveyor bottom under the push of the blade. It looks like an un-rotatable nut does translational movement along the rotating screw.
