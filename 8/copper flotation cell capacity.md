 · This leaves a finely ground powder which is agitated in a mixture of water and reagents before it is delivered to the flotation cells. Air is pumped into this mix causing it to froth and the copper mineral to float. Copper concentrates with an average 26.26% copper value are produced once the recovered copper is filtered and dried.
