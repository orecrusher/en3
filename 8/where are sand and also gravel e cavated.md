Sand gravel and specialty sand are major raw materials mined in Indiana. Weathering of rocks forms pieces of rock of various sizes and shapes as seen in Figure 1. Gravel consists of unconsolidated deposits made of pieces of rock greater than two mm in size and is almost always accompanied by sand deposits made of smaller pieces of sand.
