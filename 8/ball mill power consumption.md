## Charge behaviour and power consumption in ball mills 
 · Typical power consumption for a 5-m diameter by 7-m-long ball mill is between 2.5 and 3.5 MW. The actual proportion of this energy usefully used in size reduction is thought to be very low perhaps in the range of 1–5%. Significant financial and environmental benefits can be obtained by improving this efficiency even slightly.

Mill Power Draw Models. The mill power draw models are used to predict how much power will be consumed by a particular type of mill mill geometry and set of mill operating conditions. This power is transferred to the ore and used to predict the throughput when combined with the specific energy consumption models.
