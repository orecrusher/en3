## Different Types of Iron Ore 
 · Titanium is objected to by users of iron ores because it is said to make a pasty slag and to interfere in other ways with the smooth running of the blast furnace. At present ores containing more than 5% or 6% of titanic acid (TiO2) are not saleable.

 · Titanium is made by a batch process. In the production of iron for example there is a continuous flow through the Blast Furnace. Iron ore and coke and limestone are added to the top and iron and slag removed from the bottom. This is a very efficient way of making something. With titanium however you make it one batch at a time.
