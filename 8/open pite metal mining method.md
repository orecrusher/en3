## Mining Methods Now and in the Future 
 · But mining still starts with extracting mineral resources from the earth. Here we'll examine traditional and novel mining techniques. The American Geosciences web site defines four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.

## introduction to open pit mining method
Open pit mines can be used in coal mining and they are used extensively in "hard rock" mining for ores such as metal ores copper gold iron aluminum and many minerals. In a open pit coal mine the pit bottom would be the bottom mined coal seam elevation since it is usually feasible to extract multiple seams when surface mining coal.

Open-pit open-cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth such as long wall mining.Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.

## Opencast to underground iron ore mining method 
 · At the end of the open-pit mining process in large metal mines the mining model must change from open-pit mining to underground mining but the mutual interference between the two mining models leads to poor production safety conditions and difficulties in production convergence during the transition period. To solve these technical problems of poor production safety conditions
