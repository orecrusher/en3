## Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap – Analysis 
While iron ore is the source of around 70% of the metallic raw material inputs to steelmaking globally the rest is supplied in the form of recycled steel scrap. Steel production from scrap requires around one-eighth of the energy of that produced from iron ore – mainly in the form of electricity rather than coal for production from iron ore.

The first metallurgical step involved in this process is to reduce iron ore to metallic iron in a blast furnace using coke as both a fuel and reducing agent. The produced metallic iron contains a relatively high proportion of carbon (4%) and it is passed to the steelmaking process in the form of liquid at approximately 1450 C called as 'hot metal'.
