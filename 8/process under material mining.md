## Deep Sea Mining 
Deep Sea mining like asteroid mining is a relatively unconventional method of extracting Rare Earth elements (REEs). Unlike asteroid mining however deep sea mining has already been undertaken through projects such as deep sea diamond mining. Actual mining for REEs has not been attempted because of environmental issues and cost.

## What is Quarrying?
Quarrying is the process of removing rock sand gravel or other minerals from the ground in order to use them to produce materials for construction or other uses. So a quarry is any such working on the surface of the earth where minerals are extracted. Quarries are also known by other names around the world: 'surface mine' 'pit' 'open
