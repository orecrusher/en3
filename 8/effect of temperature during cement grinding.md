## Why Concrete Temperature Testing Is Important During 
 · Generally a concrete temperature is limited to 160°F (70°C) during hydration. If the temperature of the concrete during hydration is too high it will cause the concrete to have high early strength development but consequently gain less strength in the later stage resulting in lower durability of the structure overall.
