In metallurgy and chemical analysis an assay is a process used to determine proportions of precious metals in ores and other metallurgy substances such as silver or gold. It is important to use a precise method when identifying pollutants present within a sample especially when certain metals in low concentrations indie a high level of pollution in a mining site.
