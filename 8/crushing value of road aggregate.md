Introduction of WBM Road. The WBM full form is water-bound macadam roads. Water bound macadam are the roads which have its wearing surface consisting of the clean and crushed aggregates which are mechanically interlocked by the process of rolling and bound with each other by the filler material (screening) and water which is laid on the subgrade or base course is known as water Bound

## Aggregate 
The tests for Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) and FACT (10% Fines Aggregate Crushing Test) measure the crushing strength of broken rock. These results do not necessarily relate to the ﬂexural or compressive strength of concrete made with that aggregate but are a useful index of overall quality. Normal values for ACV range from 14 to 30% and for

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test 
Aggregate crushing value is a numerical index of the strength of the aggregate and it is used in construction of roads and pavements. Crushing value of aggregates indies its strength. Lower crushing value is recommended for roads and pavements as it indies a lower crushed fraction under load and would give a longer service life and a more economical performance.

## crushing value for aggregate in road 
The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS 2386 Part 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.
