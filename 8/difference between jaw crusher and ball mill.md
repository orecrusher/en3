## how a jaw crusher works and what it is used for
A Jaw Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws (feed opening). For instance a 24 x 36 jaw crusher has a opening of 24" by 36" a 56 x 56 jaw crusher has a opening of 56" square.

## How porcelain is made 
To make porcelain the raw materials—such as clay felspar and silica—are first crushed using jaw crushers hammer mills and ball mills. After cleaning to remove improperly sized materials the mixture is subjected to one of four forming processes—soft plastic forming stiff plastic forming pressing or casting—depending on the type of ware being produced.
