 · Porosity can occur when contaminates from abrasive products release from the wheel and contaminate weld surfaces. This compromises the structural integrity of the weld. It is critical to remove surface contaminates prior to welding including grease oil dirt or paint and only use high quality contaminate-free abrasives for surface preparation and inter-pass grinding.

## Welding 
 · Remove coatings from the weld area to minimize the fume. The removal of coating will also improve weld quality. Use stripping products to remove coatings. Make sure to remove any residues before welding. Use wet slurry vacuum removal techniques for removing very toxic coatings. Do not grind coatings. Grinding dust may be toxic.
