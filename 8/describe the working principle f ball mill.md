## Ball Milling 
 · In roller mills the principle of attrition is used where material is sheared as it passes through a gap and is transferred from slower roll to a faster roll and is removed by a scraper. In ball mill size reduction is done by both impact and attrition of particles. Rod mill is similar to ball mills but it uses long rods for grinding media.
