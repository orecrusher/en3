## How to Smelt Iron: The 6 Steps to Iron Smelting 
1. Gather iron ore. Iron ore can be bought or gathered but for the sake of demonstration we gathered the ore ourselves. The best time to collect iron ore is in the winter because the ocean is more active. Active waves separate the black magnetic sand from lighter silica sand.

## Iron Ore 
Iron Ore. Iron (Fe) is a metallic element which constitutes about 5% of the Earth's crust and is the fourth most abundant element in the crust. Iron ores are rocks from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The principal iron ores are hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ). Almost all iron ore is used in blast furnaces to

 · Iron ore is used as the iron source coal as the reducing agent and limestone as a flux agent. These materials are mixed and charged onto the bed of carbonaceous material and are then heated by burners. In this process the iron ore is reduced and melted and the coal mixed in the raw material layer is gasified and acts as a reducing agent.

iron processing - iron processing - Ores: Iron ores occur in igneous metamorphic (transformed) or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary but many have been changed by weathering and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3) which is

## Can We Make Steel Without Coal? 
 · A particular rank of coal known as "coking coal" is required to make the preferred quality of coke. Then raw iron is made by reducing (removing the oxygen from) iron ore (iron oxide) by reacting it at high temperature with coke in a blast furnace. About half of the carbon in the coke combines with the oxygen from the iron ore to make CO2.

DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state i.e. without melting as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen coming from reformed natural gas syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

 · Not all iron ore is equal – producers of blast furnace feedstock would be hit hardest by aggressive acceleration in scrap adoption. The result will be an industry even more dominated by the "Big 4" iron ore majors: Vale Rio Tinto BHP and Fortescue Metals. Many small players especially those producing low-grade ore would struggle to survive unless they were captive to (green) steel producers.

## How does coke and coal play into steel making? 
 · Coke is used as a fuel and a reducing agent in melting iron ore. It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke making it ideal for smelting iron and steel. Prior to the 1880's steel was produced using charcoal.
