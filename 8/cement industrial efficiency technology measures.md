## Cement Production 
G. Habert in Eco-efficient Construction and Building Materials 2014 10.1 Introduction. Cement production has undergone tremendous developments since its beginnings some 2000 years ago. While the use of cement in concrete has a very long history (Malinowsky 1991) the industrial production of cements started in the middle of the 19 th century first with shaft kilns which were later

 · In the cement industry however this link is weak. The industry's record of value creation is spotty with ROIC levels roughly equal to the cost of capital at around 9 percent. Behind the lackluster ROIC two drivers stand out: high goodwill (seen in the low tangible capital ratio) and inadequate capital efficiency. Call it bad timing.

Measures to decrease energy consumption and to improve resource efficiency will de facto reduce CO 2 emissions (hence the focus on CO 2 emissions). The combination of process emissions (emissions released when limestone is transformed into lime during the production process) and emissions from the required thermal energy leads to substantial CO2emissions for each tonne of cement.

cement/concrete industry. The cover diagram shows a thermal image of an operating kiln. The high temperature of the kiln surface (300°F to 400°F) accounts for about a 5% energy efficiency loss. The diagram on the cover depicts a kiln that has lost insulating refractory material and shows hot spots and a hot ring that will require future repair.
