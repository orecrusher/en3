The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.
