## Tips for maintaining efficiency in crushing circuits 
 · In practice many jaw crushers are not fed to their design capacity; this is because the subsequent processing plant does not have sufficient capacity to handle the volume of material that would be produced if the jaw crusher were working to capacity. Crushing setting: Efficiency. Ideally the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6:1.
