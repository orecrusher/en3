The function of compounding moulding extrusion and vulcanisation are similar to that of the process explained for rubber products. Compounding is a dispersion process which is done using a dispersion mill (ball mill attritor mill etc). Dipping is done to give a shape to the product in a former (mould) as per the end product specifiion.

## Rubber Compounding 
Rubber Compounding. Rubber compounding involves the science and engineering of rubbers and rubber additives such as processing aids fillers and curing agents in definite proportions to obtain a uniform mixture that will have desirable physical and chemical properties to meet processing at low cost and end use performance.

Thermoplastics resins are sold as moulding compounds. Fiber reinforcement is apt for these resins. Since the fibers are randomly dispersed the reinforcement will be almost isotropic. However when subjected to moulding processes they can be aligned directionally. There are a few options to increase heat resistance in thermoplastics.
