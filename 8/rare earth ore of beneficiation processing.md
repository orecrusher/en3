## Chemical Beneficiation Process of Obtaining Rare Earth 
In this project we want to address beneficiation as one of the aspects of the chemical process of obtaining rare earth form the naturally occurring ores. Beneficiation is the second step of mining after the ore is removed from the ground. Beneficiation process is divided into two steps i.e. physical beneficiation and chemical beneficiation.
