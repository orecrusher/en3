The restraining effect of aggregate to drying shrinkage strain depends much on the bond between aggregate and cement paste. the coarse aggregates (limestone crushed and uncrushed gravel) were normal-weight (IOS ). for testing concrete specimens (100×100×400 mm prisms 100×200 mm and 150×300 mm cylinders).

## Substation Grounding: Role of Crushed Rock – Voltage 
 · Crushed rock is useful in reducing step and touch potentials. Resistivity value of crushed rock depends on many factors such as type of locally available material size of stone washed vs un-washed stone etc. Washed rocks have less dust and has more resistivity compared to un-washed ones. Removing dust also aids in faster drying time after a rain.

## Aggregate testing 
Aggregates can be obtained from a variety of sources: from natural sands and gravels of both land and sea origin to crushed rock and artificially produced materials. They can be used in many ways: as major components of concrete mortar or bituminous bound materials as sub-base or capping or for more specialised uses such as track ballast or filter media.

The popularity of the Micro-Deval test has increased in recent years because of its accuracy and repeatability as well as convenience and the smaller scale of the apparatus.
