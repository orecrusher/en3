Reclamation processes. As part of the life cycle of a surface coal mine completed mine areas must undergo rehabilitation.When mining ends operators must restore the land to its approximate original contour (AOC) or leave the land graded and suitable for a "higher and better" post-mining land use (PMLU) that has been approved as part of the original mining permit appliion.
