Types of Circuits. Parallel Circuits Illustration. 2008 HowStuffWorks. A closed circuit has a complete path for current to flow. An open circuit doesn't which means that it's not functional. If this is your first exposure to circuits you might think that when a circuit is open it's like an open door or gate that current can flow through. And

Open circuit voltage (or potential) is voltage which is not connected to any load in a circuit. See the two examples below to see the difference between open circuit voltage with a voltage source which is in a closed circuit and connected to a load. As you can see open circuit voltage is disconnected and does not form a complete circuit.

We can also say that a switch is used to close or open an electrical circuit. When the switch is on the circuit is closed. An electric current then exists in the circuit. We could also say there is an unbroken electric pathway in the circuit. When the switch is off the circuit is open. In this case there is no electric current in the circuit.

## What is the difference between an open and closed circuit 
 · A closed circuit is where the current flow path is as expected. This is "normal" operation. Often the difference between an open and a closed circuit is that the controlling switch is open or closed.

## Open Circuit: What is it? (And How Does it Differ To a 
 · An open circuit is defined as an electric circuit in which current does not flow. Current can only flow in a circuit if it finds a continuous path—known as a "closed circuit". If there's a break anywhere in the circuit you have an open circuit and current can not flow. In an open circuit the two terminals are disconnected.

Open circuit scuba sets. Newspapers and television news often describe open circuit scuba wrongly as "oxygen" equipment probably by false analogy from aeroplane pilots' oxygen cylinders.. At partial pressures over about 1.2 to 1.6 atmospheres oxygen becomes toxic.Open circuit scuba may supply various breathing gases; but rarely pure oxygen except during decompression stops in technical diving.

## Closed Open and Short Circuits 
A closed circuit allows current to flow but an open circuit leaves electrons stranded. Picture a gallon of water flowing through an open pipe. The water will flow for a short time but then stop when all the water exits the pipe. If you pump water through a closed pipe system the water will continue to flow as long as you keep forcing it to move.
