## Variables in Ball Mill Operation 
Ball mill operation is often regarded as something of a mystery for several reasons. Ball milling is not an art - it's just physics. The first problem will ball mills is that we cannot see what is occurring in the mill. The other problem is that many of the independent variables are non-linear or have paradoxical effects on the end results.
