## Chemical Processing of Phosphate 
Chemical Processing of Phosphate. The phosphate mineral as it exists in the ground is not soluble and is hard for the plant to access. To provide the plant with the phosphate it needs in a form it can take up through its roots the phosphate rock is converted to phosphoric acid.

## Minerals 
Phosphate ore is an important raw material for manufacturing fertilizers and phosphorous chemical products. While most of the phosphate resources cannot be directly treated as feed stock due to the low grade of P2O5 and high content of impurities. In order to obtain a qualified phosphate concentrate the beneficiation of the low-grade phosphate ore is hence of great necessity.

## How phosphate is mined and processed
The phosphate is sent to a chemical processing plant or fertilizer manufacturing plant. Here molten sulfur shipped to Florida ports and trucked to the plant is used to create sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid is then mixed with the phosphate to make phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid is the main ingredient in fertilizer but can also be used in animal feed supplements soda or soap.

## Beneficiation 
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.
