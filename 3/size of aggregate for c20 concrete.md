If a large quantity (several cubic metres or more) of concrete of specified characteristic strength is required then it is suggested that ready-mixed concrete is used.

Concrete mix ratios are expressed in two ways: one is expressed in materials used per cubic meter of concrete (Water: Cement: Sand: Gravel) and the other is expressed as a ratio of various materials. for example C:S:G = 1:2.3:4.2 and W/C = 0.6.

 · In the chapter on high-performance concrete it states that substituting about 8% of the cement with condensed silica fume "could enhance strength". It also says that tests done with South African aggregates have shown that the "optimum nominal size for coarse aggregate" i.e. crushed stone – is 19-26.5 mm.

## Concrete and Screed: What's the Difference? 
 · When we are mixing concrete we add coarse aggregate like gravel to the mix. These small stones are normally 20mm or less in size. This coarse aggregate gives the concrete its strength durability and workability and makes it suitable for structural work. For screed we don't use the gravelly aggregate that we put in our concrete.
