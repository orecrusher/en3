## Pressing And Sintering Of Powder Parts
Powder SinteringPowder sintering involves raising the temperature of the green compact (pressed powder part) to a certain level and keeping it at that temperature for a certain amount of time. The sintering temperature is usually between 70% and 90% of the melting point of the powder metal. This will cause bonding mechanisms to occur between powder particles pressed together in the compact.

## What Are the Uses of Magnetite? 
 · It is also used in coal mining operations as a slurry with water to remove the heavier impurities by allowing the less dense coal to float to the surface. The magnetite can be reused in this process 90 percent of the time. Magnetite is also used as a source of iron to manufacture iron-based chemicals and fertilizers.
