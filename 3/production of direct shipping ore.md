## Iron Ore Statistics and Information 
Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. The seven largest of these producing countries

High-grade hematite ore is referred to as direct shipping ore (DSO) because after it is mined the ores go through a relatively simple crushing and screening process before being exported for use in steelmaking. Australia's hematite DSO from the Hamersley region in Western Australia averages from 56% to 62% iron.
