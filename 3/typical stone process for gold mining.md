## Crushing in Mineral Processing
 · In mineral processing or metallurgy the first stage of comminution is crushing.. Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate/surface.

## Gold Mining Mining Shares 
Gold is more frequently deposited in the concentrations which make gold mining viable. Gold's average concentration in the Earth's crust is 0.005 parts per million. The technology of extraction is expensive primarily because the process always requires gold mining companies to manipulate large physical quantities of ore for small results.

## » The Basics of Successful Gold Mining
Gold deposits along the general gold path can be small or large depending upon the size of the gold trap. The most important type of gold trap in river mining is called the "pay-streak". Pay-streaks always form along the gold path where the river's flow slows down on a large scale during a major flood storm.
