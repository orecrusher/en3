## Rock Crushers for Commercial Gold Mining Operations 
 · This is because the rocks have to be crushed to very fine gravels that can allow for gold molecules to be dissolved in mercury or any other chemical used to extract gold from the ore. What this means is that in large scale mining the mines may have more than one crusher (primary secondary and tertiary crushers) in order to achieve the desired crushing levels.

One of the most common dusts encountered on mine sites is quartz (crystalline silica) which is a mineral found in many ore bodies. In the past workers could develop silicosis but an understanding of how to minimise exposure has meant there have been no new cases of silicosis in miners solely employed in Western Australian mines for over 40 years.

The separation process is particularly difficult due to the usually low quantity of gold relative to waste. Common gold grades are in the same magnitude as about 5 g/t or 0.000005% gold content by weight. This means that upgrading the concentration by a factor of 3000 to 4000 is commonly required to achieve commercial ore (Marsden House 2009).

The rock is then dumped into an ore bin until being fed through ore bin gates into an ore feeder then into the stamp mortar. When the rock runs through the stamp battery the finely crushed mixture is washed over a series of copper plates coated with mercury (amalgamation tables) where the freed gold combines with the mercury to form what is called amalgam (the process of amalgamation).
