## coarse aggregate for concrete 
Coarse aggregate Article about coarse aggregate by TheSenthamarai and Devadas (2005) focused on the usage of industrial ceramic waste as replacement of natural coarse aggregate. Experiments made in this study include compressive splitting tensile and flexural strengths of the concrete made with the ceramic coarse aggregate.

## Shape Size 
Shape of three dimensional irregular bodies as coarse aggregate is difficult to describe; but is the vital property affecting the workability of fresh concrete and also its strength and durability. The characteristic of parent rock from which coarse aggregates have been produced and also the type of crusher used for crushing influence the shape of coarse aggregates.

## What is a coarse aggregate
Coarse aggregate is the portion of the concrete which is made up of the larger stones embedded in the mix. Concrete contains three ingredients; Water cement and aggregate. That aggregate is made of fine sand and coarse gravel.

## Difference Between Fine and Coarse Aggregate 
Aggregates are essential components of concrete. They act as inert material in concrete. Fine aggregate and coarse aggregate are two main types of aggregate for concrete.As the name indies they are basically classified depending on the sizes of aggregate particles.. Fine Aggregate vs Coarse Aggregate

## Aggregates 
Coarse aggregates are any particles greater than 0.19 inch but generally range between 3/8 and 1.5 inches in diameter. Gravels constitute the majority of coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone making up most of the remainder. Natural gravel and sand are usually dug or dredged from a pit river lake or seabed.

## How to Choose Quality Coarse Aggregate for Concrete 
Coarse aggregate should contain various fraction sizes to ensure adequate compaction of particles hence resulting in increased density and reduced voids in concrete. In the majority of concrete works aggregate sizes of 20 mm or smaller are used.

## Recycling of Brick Aggregate Concrete as Coarse Aggregate 
Based on this investigation it is revealed that recycled brick aggregate can be used as coarse aggregate for making concrete of strength 20.7 to 31.0 MPa. For the same mix design the recycled aggregate concrete produces almost similar strength compared with the first class brick aggregate concrete commonly used in Bangladesh.
