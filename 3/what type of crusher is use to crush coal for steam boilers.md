A cyclone-fired boiler uses large crushed coal particles (typically 4 mesh size) which must be burned at a slower rate than PC 1 to complete the combustion process. This slower rate of combustion requires a unique burner design. 2 The burner's assembly is a long round chamber (6- to 10-ft. diameter) formed by water wall tubes attached to the outside of the boiler's furnace wall.
