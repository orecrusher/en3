Gasifiion processes. In conventional plants coal often pulverised is burned with excess air (to give complete combustion) resulting in very dilute carbon dioxide at the rate of 800 to 1200 g/kWh. Gasifiion converts the coal to burnable gas with the maximum amount of potential energy from the coal being in the gas.
