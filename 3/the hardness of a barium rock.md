## Rockwell hardness test 
 · In the Rockwell hardness test the measure of the hardness is not an indentation surface but an indentation depth. Either a carbide ball or a rounded diamond cone with a tip angle of 120° and a tip radius of 0.2 mm serves as the indenter. The indentation depth can be read directly from a dial gauge via the traverse path of the testing machine.
