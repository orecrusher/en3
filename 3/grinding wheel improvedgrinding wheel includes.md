## Titanium and Titanium Alloys 
 · Grinding wheel selection – Silicon carbide can be used at surface m/min ( ft/min) to give optimum surface finish and minimum wheel wear. The high speeds essential with these wheels produce intense sparking which can cause a fire hazard. The work piece should be flooded with coolant to reduce sparking.
