## Crushing Plant Performance Optimization 
In a crushing plant the normal procedure for studying and improving the process is by means of measurements rules of thumb and visual observations. However these tools and methods are inadequate for more advanced analyses of the complex processes that characterize many crushing plants. In order to improve the process both technical and economic factors must be taken into account.

## Thermal Power Plant Thermal 
☛ THERMAL POWER PLANT OPERATION. The working principle of thermal power plant operation depends on Rankin Cycle. In a thermal power plant coal is coming from coal storage and burnt in the boiler.It converts water into steam. This steam is expanded in the prime-mover (i.e. turbine) which produces mechanical power driving the alternator coupled to the turbine.
