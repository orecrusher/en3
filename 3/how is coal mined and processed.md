## mining coal
The major stigma associated with the coal industry today is the abandoned or "orphan" mines of the early coal mining years. These orphan mines are systematically being reclaimed under the Surface Mining Act taxes coal producers at the rate of 35 cents a ton for surface mined coal 10 cents a ton for lignite mined coal and 15 cents a ton for underground mined coal.

## What Is the Environmental Impact of Mining and Burning 
Coal is composed almost entirely of carbon so burning coal unleashes large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO 2) into the atmosphere. These emissions have been shown to increase the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere and lead to global warming. Subsurface coal mining is dangerous. Coal is often mined in subsurface mines which may collapse and
