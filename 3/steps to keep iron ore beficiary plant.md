Iron ore. Iron doesn't occur naturally. Being highly reactive it combines easily with other minerals to form ores. Those with the highest iron content are found near the surface of the earth and are relatively easy to mine. The principal iron ores are hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4). Most iron ore is extracted through opencast mines.
