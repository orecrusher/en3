## Cut
A cut-off grade (COG) is an industry-accepted standard expression used to determine what part of a mineral deposit to include in a mineral resource estimate (MRE). For MRE reporting COGs tend to be rounded down to ensure that material of no economic significance is excluded from the resource.

 · The milling cut-off grade for this operation is calculated to be 0.30g/t. It means that a tonne of ore with 0.3g/t can be sent to the mill and be expected to generate a small amount of profit. Ten percent dilution in this mine will reduce the grade of ore from 0.3g/t to 0.28g/t which is below cut-off grade and will not be able to return a profit.

 · Some reasonable cut-off grade needs to be applied to the mineral inventory prior to reporting them as mineral resources. A table or chart of sensitivity to cut-off grade may be supplied but zero or near-zero cut-off grades may not be reported in most cases. The methods of determining cut-off grade can vary particularly for open pit deposits.

## Ore grades and mining 
The cut-off grade of an ore is essentially the lowest grade of an ore that is worth mining. If the ore grade is less than the cut-off grade then a mining company will not make money mining that ore. According to Fellows (2010) the cut-off grade of an ore is one of the main factors in determining the economics of the mine.
