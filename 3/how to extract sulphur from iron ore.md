Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

In lean coal and lignite sulfur is predominantly present as organic compounds. According to experiments with a QMC-230 mass spectrometer and an IR absorption analyzer the removal of sulfur in the reduction of iron-ore concentrates is hindered by the adsorption of sulfur-bearing gases and its absorption by the reduced iron to form FeS which is not reduced by carbon or hydrogen.

The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.
