## Ball Mill: Operating principles components Uses 
 · A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 – 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

Ball mill. A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill.A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls usually stone or metal which grind material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls. Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%.

## How to Make a Ball Mill: 12 Steps (with Pictures) 
 · Ball mills are a special instrument used to break up hard solids into a fine powder. They are similar to rock tumblers in that the instrument is a rotating container filled with heavy balls to grind the substance into powder. Ceramic material crystalline compounds and even some metals can be ground up using a ball mill.

Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilie materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.
