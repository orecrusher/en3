## Density of Steel 
 · It contains small amounts of manganese and even smaller amounts of silicon phosphorous oxygen sulfur and other elements. Henry Bessemer created the Bessemer process in 1856 to manufacture steel cheaply. Density is one of the numerous properties of steel. It is calculated by dividing the mass by the volume. Steel comes in many different forms.

## Significant Enhancement of the Thermoelectric Performance 
 · Higher manganese silicide (HMS) is a naturally abundant eco-friendly and low-cost p-type thermoelectric semiconductor with high power factor (PF); however its figure of merit (ZT) is very low due to an intrinsically high thermal conductivity (κ). It is also difficult to synthesize a HMS single phase without MnSi or Si second phase which generally leads to a significant decrease of the PF

## Dynamic Modelling of Temperature in a Wet Ball Mill Based 
 · A dynamic model is developed for a wet overflow ball mill based on a set of mass and energy balances. The energy balance relies on temperature and mass flow data. The key model parameters to be measured are mill temperature in the feed and discharge streams mill power draw and the mass flow rate in the feed stream.
