## Sand Casting For Manufacture 
Usually sand used to manufacture a mold for the casting process is held together by a mixture of water and clay. A typical mixture by volume could be 89% sand 4% water 7% clay. Control of all aspects of the properties of sand is crucial when manufacturing parts by sand casting therefore a sand laboratory is usually attached to the foundry.
