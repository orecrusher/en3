## Field appliions of gypsum reduce pH and improve soil C 
 · Highly alkaline soils are widespread throughout south-eastern Australia. High pH limits the accumulation and retention of organic carbon (C) and thus the availability of nutrients to crops and is also associated with various elemental deficiencies and toxicities that restricts crop productivity.

## Alkali Soils: Factors Effects and Reclamation
Soils in which salinity is mainly due to accumulation of alkali salts are called alkali soils or usar soils. High alkalinity in the soil adversely affects the plant growth thereby reduces the crop yield. Such sterile or unproductive soils are called barren soils. The main salts present in the alkali soils are Na 2 SO 4 K 2 SO 4 NaCl and KCl.

Gypsum is not acid soluble and will not change the soil pH. It helps to shift the Ca and Mg levels in soil and offers a readily available form of sulfate sulfur a valuable secondary nutrient that benefits the soil and crop. The sulfate in gypsum binds with excess Mg in the soil to form soluble Epsom salt which moves lower into the soil profile.

## the impact of gypsum on alkaline soil 
Alkali or Alkaline soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5) a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate which causes the soil to swell and difficult to clarify/settle.
