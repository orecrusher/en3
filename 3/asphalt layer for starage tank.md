## Tank Venting 
Vent dryers are sometimes used to prevent the ingress of moisture into a tank storing concentrated sulphuric acid. The hygroscopic nature of concentrated sulphuric acid means that any moisture entering the tank will be quickly absorbed into the acid. Over time the top layer of acid will become more dilute and more corrosive.
