## Extraction Method Of Cassiterite 
Extraction Method Of Cassiterite. Extraction of metals.The process of extracting metal ores buried deep underground is called mining.The metal ores are found in the earths crust in varying abundance.The extraction of metals from ores is what allows us to use the minerals in the ground the ores are very different from the finished metals that we see in buildings and bridges.

A tailings assaying 0.4% Sn is taken from a flotation process which is used to recover Cu Pb and Zn. The cassiterite in the tailings is of fine dissemination and complex composition which leads to difficulties to recover by traditional gravity concentration. In order to enhance the recovery of Sn and make good use of the tailings particle size analysis and chemical analysis were conducted.
