## Coarse Aggregates: Types Properites Appliions
Coarse aggregates are irregular broken stones or naturally occurring round gravels that are used to make concrete coarse aggregates for structural concrete consist of broken stones of hard rock like granite and limestone (angular aggregates) or river gravels (round aggregates). Aggregates larger than 4.75 mm in size are termed as coarse
