## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron 
 · The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process. The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace. These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.

## Manufacture of Steel 
 · The first step in the steel manufacture begins at the blast furnace. To separate iron from iron ore coke (substance when gas is taken out of coal) limestone and dolomite are charged into the blast furnace. Temperature raised to 1600oF. This high temp causes the coke to burn and melt the iron. This red hot iron drained at an opening at the base of the furnace.

Iron ore is any rock or mineral from which iron can economically be extracted. It comes in a variety of colors including dark gray bright yellow deep purple and rusty red. The iron comes in the form of iron oxides such as magnetite hematite limonite goethite or siderite. Economically viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron.
