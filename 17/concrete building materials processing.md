 · Concrete can stand for thousands of years and gain strength as it ages where other building materials can rot rust and burn. Concrete from old buildings and demolished bridges as examples can be crushed reduced and incorporated into new batches as the aggregate component. It can also be used as rip rap and new road bases.

## 7 Innovative Building Materials That Are Set To Change The 
A concrete with the capabilities to patch over its own fractures would undoubtedly be a boon to the building industry eliminating cracks repairs and leaks along with the need for damp-proofing. Strangely enough however the idea of a self-healing concrete has been around since ancient Rome where it was used underwater but modern approaches are comparatively more sophistied.

## Understanding the Process of Corrosion in Reinforced Concrete
 · These cracks make their way to the surface of the concrete which causes even more CO2 and chloride to penetrate the concrete and speed up the process of corrosion. Corrosion is responsible for up to 90% of damage to reinforced concrete structures.-Ueli Angst Professor Institute for Building Materials. The Cost of Concrete Corrosion
