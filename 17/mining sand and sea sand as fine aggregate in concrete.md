## Why we can't use sea sand in building construction? – we 
 · Sea sand tends to very fine and rounded Smooth rounded particles would offer less resistance to rearrangement than angular or elongated particles with rough surfaces. In sea water chloride is present which will cause corrosion of steel and iron which ultimately leads to reducing carrying capacity of steel and iron so that the structure built using this may not be sustainable.

## What type of gravel is used in concrete? 
 · Gravels constitute the majority of coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone making up most of the remainder. Natural gravel and sand are usually dug or dredged from a pit river lake or seabed. Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock boulders cobbles or large-size gravel.
