 · The world's 20 largest copper mines produce nearly 9 million metric tons of the precious metal a year about 40% of the world's total copper mine capacity. Chile and Peru alone account for more than half of the copper mines on this list. The U.S. makes the cut as well with two mines among the top 20. Copper is expensive to mine and refine.

## Copper extraction 
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source local environmental regulations and other factors.. As in all mining operations the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## Ball Mill 
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

## How copper is made 
Copper is one of the basic chemical elements. The mixture of ore and water is further broken up in two ball mills which are like a rod mill except steel balls are used instead of rods. The slurry of finely ground ore that emerges from the final ball mill contains particles about 0.01 in (0.25 mm) in diameter

 · Copper powders were subjected to high-energy ball milling under air or argon atmospheres. The Cu crystallite size determined from the X-ray diffraction data decreased from 57 to 33 nm and 27 nm after 6 h of milling under argon and air respectively.Milling under air led to copper particles having a wide particle size distribution (70–700 μm) with an irregular shape and to a slight

 · After ball-milling for 5 h GO nanosheets with small thickness are adsorbed on the surface of copper powders and nearly no GO nanosheets clusters are found (Fig. 3f) indiing that GO nanosheets are effectively dispersed into the copper matrix. With further increasing the ball-milling time the size of GO nanosheets decreases.
