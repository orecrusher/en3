 · The study of model rockets the flight of a baseball or the "bend" of a soccer kick are excellent ways for students to learn the basics of forces and the response of an object to external forces. A ball in flight has no engine to produce continuous thrust and the resulting flight is similar to the flight of shell from a cannon or a bullet from a gun.

 · At impact the altitude is zero. Using the altitude equation: y = 0. Vo t = .5 g t^2. t = 2 Vo / g. The total flight time varies linearly with the launch velocity. The total flight time is twice the time to reach maximum altitude. So a ballistic shell takes as long coming down as it does going up.

Ball nosed cutters: slow nose speed. The biggest challenge with ball nosed end mills of various kinds is slow nose speed. As you get closer to the tip the diameter on the ball gets smaller and smaller finally going to zero. As a result the cutter must perform over a wide range of surface speeds and chip loads at different depths in the cut.
