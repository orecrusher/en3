## Critical raw materials 
Why critical raw materials are important. Link to industry - non-energy raw materials are linked to all industries across all supply chain stages; Modern technology - technological progress and quality of life rely on access to a growing number of raw materials. For example a smartphone might contain up to 50 different kinds of metals all of which contribute to its small size light weight

## Magnetic and Gravity Methods in Mineral Exploration: the 
Magnetic methods are more popular in mineral exploration than gravity not least because magnetic data can be quickly recorded from the air and in conjunction with other geophysical surveys. Land gravity surveys by contrast may require greater field efforts (Figs. 1 5 and 6) more time and more commitment of scarce capital.

 · The Streak Test: Marks known as "streaks" are produced by scraping mineral specimens across unglazed porcelain plates. On the left a specimen of pyrite has produced a black streak. On the right a specimen of rhodochrosite has produced a white streak. Many minerals produce a white streak and some geologists prefer using a black streak plate

Nearly all references to magnetism found in gemological literature tell us that very few gemstones are magnetic but this is misleading information based on testing with traditional magnets. With the aid of strong neodymium magnets in conjunction with the floatation method we have discovered that a large percentage of gemstones show a measurable degree of magnetic attraction.

## Magnetic Survey 
A magnetic survey can map out changes in the amount of magnetic minerals as well as associated rock types. Thus a magnetic map can help loe mineral deposits by identifying specific rock types and geological features (Stevens 2010 ). Magnetic surveys can be conducted either from the air or ground with a magnetometer.

The mineral magnetite is named after this characteristic. Magnetism occurs (most often) when there is an imbalance in the structural arrangement of the iron ions. Iron is found in two principle ionic states called ferrous and ferric ions. The ferrous ion has charge of positive two (+2); the ferric ion has a charge of positive three (+3).
