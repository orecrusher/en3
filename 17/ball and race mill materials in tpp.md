In these bearings the rolling part is a ball which rolls between inner and outer rings called races. The balls are held by a cage which keeps them evenly spaced around the races. In addition to these parts there are a lot of optional parts for special bearings like seals to keep oil or grease in and dirt out or screws to hold a bearing in place.

## Rolling
A rolling-element bearing also known as a rolling bearing is a bearing which carries a load by placing rolling elements (such as balls or rollers) between two bearing rings called races.The relative motion of the races causes the rolling elements to roll with very little rolling resistance and with little sliding.. One of the earliest and best-known rolling-element bearings are sets of logs

The ball valve is an inexpensive alternative to other valves. Ball valves use a metal ball with a hole bored through the center sandwiched between two seats to control flow.

## Race (bearing) 
In the case of ball bearings the bearing has inner and outer races and a set of balls. Each race is a ring with a groove where the balls rest. The groove is usually shaped so the ball is a slightly loose fit in the groove. Thus in principle the ball contacts each race at a single point. However a load on an infinitely small point would
