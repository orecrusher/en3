## Cohesive strength of iron ore granules 
We present an experimental and numerical investigation of the mechanical strength of crude iron ore (Hematite) granules in which capillary bonds between primary particles are the source of internal cohesion. The strength is measured by subjecting the granules to vertical compression between two plates. We show that the behavior of the granules is ductile with a well-defined plastic threshold

The compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence for this region = where this time E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.
