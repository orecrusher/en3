## Processing Spodumene by Froth Flotation for Lithium Extraction
 · Reagents for the removal of iron minerals include a combination such as hydrofluoric acid for a pH of 5 sodium resinate and a frother. The conditioned pulp is then diluted to a 20-25% solids for flotation. Complete removal of iron minerals along with some remaining feldspar is accomplished in a froth product which is small and is discarded.

From the formula it is clear that iron and sulfur have to be removed in order to produce copper. The roasting process: changes some of the CuFeS 2 to copper oxide; removes some of the sulfur as sulfur dioxide; This is done by heating the concentrated ore from froth flotation. It is heated to between 500 °C and 700 °C in air.
