## Effect of high
Ball mills are called high-energy mill because of the large energy dissipated in the process of collision and friction of balls with the container wall [7]. High-energy ball milling is a relatively new technique that has appliions in processes for obtaining nanostructured materials or it is used in solid reactions.

## Effect of Heating Temperature of Expandable Graphite on 
Two expanded graphites EG1 and EG2 that were prepared by rapid heating expandable graphite to 600 and 1000 °C respectively were ball milled in a high-energy mill under an air atmosphere with 16.7% nickel addition. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the products show that that increasing the heating temperature of expandable graphite accelerates the amorphous process of the EG-Ni systems

 · How does cold weather impact steel? Low temperatures can adversely affect the tensile toughness of many commonly-used materials in the engineering world. Tensile toughness is a measure of a material's brittleness or ductility (the tendency to deform before fracturing); it is often estimated by calculating the area beneath the stress-strain curve.

## » What's normal:The role of temperature in bearing 
 · The ball bearings used in most electric motors are pre-greased shielded ball bearings. Normal motor bearing operating temperatures range from 140° to 160°F. As in all bearing appliions this measurement should be taken at the bearing outer ring.
