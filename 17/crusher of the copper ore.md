Ore is processed using conventional techniques and differential flotation. Ore is passed to the primary crusher and crushed to 150mm. This is passed to the secondary and tertiary crushers and ground to 16mm. After milling the ore is fed into the flotation circuit. Following differential flotation zinc lead and copper concentrates are produced.

 · Crushed ore is screened and sized to remove fines; these are treated by flotation to produce copper concentrate that is sold for smelting to produce 10000–12000t/y of additional copper. Heap leaching of ore uses dynamic stacking in 6m lifts and chemical and bacteriological dissolution of copper through consecutive lifts from the top to the bottom of the heap.
