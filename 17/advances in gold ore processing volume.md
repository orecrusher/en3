## Simplifying sample processing: New gold assay method 
 · For example gold is mined commercially at low concentrations is often irregularly distributed in ores and can be difficult to sample due to its malleability and resistance to pulverization. I n addition to the analytical challenges of determining gold concentrations in mineral ores the chemical and physical properties of samples need to be altered before analysis.

## Tailingsfo What Are Tailings? 
This is not surprising when considering that the volume of tailings requiring storage can often exceed the in-situ total volume of the ore being mined and processed. Over the last century the volumes of tailings being generated has grown dramatically as the demand for minerals and metals has increased and lower grades of ore are being mined through advances in extraction and processing technology.

 · The gold cyanide complex is then extracted from the pulp or slurry by adsorption onto activated carbon. CIL stands for carbon-in-leach. This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to the leach tanks (or reaction vessel) so that leaching and adsorption take place in the same tanks.
