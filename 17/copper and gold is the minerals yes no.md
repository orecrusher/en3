Minerals make up most of what we use to build manufacture and stand on — including rocks and soil — so if we really ran out of minerals we'd all be scrambling for a spot on the planet's shrunken surface areas.. But if you were worried about running out of a single mineral important for industry then you probably can breathe easy. Most of the minerals we use a lot are very abundant.

Strong generalities exist in this class. The majority of sulfides are metallic opaque generally sectile soft to average in hardness and they have high densities black or dark-colored streaks and an igneous origin.
