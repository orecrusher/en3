## Principle and Working of MILLING MACHINE 
 · Introduction: Milling is the cutting operation that removes metal by feeding the work against a rotating cutter having single or multiple cutting edges. Flat or curved surfaces of many shapes can be machined by milling with good finish and accuracy. A milling machine may also be used for drilling slotting making a circular profile and gear cutting by having suitable attachments.
