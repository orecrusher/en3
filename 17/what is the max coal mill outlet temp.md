## Volatile Matter (Part of Proximate Analysis) Coal 
 · Volatile matter is essentially a measure of the nonwater gases formed from a coal sample during heating. It is measured as the weight percent of gas (emissions) from a coal sample that is released during heating to 950 C° in an oxygen-free environment except for moisture (which will evaporate as water vapor) at a standardized temperature.
