## Potash: A silent crisis brews 
 · Potash is plentiful in the Northern Hemisphere where producers in Canada Belarus and Russia dominate the world market. Manning said three countries produce more than 70 percent of the world's potash with little or no production in Africa South Asia and Australasia. "We have got a serious problem of geographic distribution" he said.

## Secondary aluminum (REKAL) 
K+S recycles salt slag from the secondary aluminum industry completely residue-free. By this we mean: completely one hundred percent. Our specially developed REKAL® plant extracts the reusable aluminum from the slag. The process is rounded off by the separated substances potassium chloride aluminum oxide and ammonium sulfate.

## Intensifiion of the flotation separation of potash ore 
Potash ores are a mixture of sylvite (KCl) halite (NaCl) To reduce the overgrinding of ore and formation of slime each crushing stage was followed by screening to remove from grinding circuit the material of a particle size of <1 mm corresponding to the flotation feed.

It contains 2.8% Fe2 O 3 19.9% Al 2 O 3 55.5% SiO 2 and 5.4% K 2O as its prime constituents. Magnetic separation and flotation techniques are found unsuitable to recover appreciable amounts of potassium values.

 · The use of rod mills for grinding also proves beneficial in liberating the clay. Two-stage scrubbing is common in the high insol areas. The des stage is considered critical as a virtually slime-free product is necessary to minimize reagent costs and to ensure good potash recovery. Des is accomplished in two or three stages.

## Advantages of Cryo Grinding 
Ultra-fine Particle Grinding. OGL's cryo grinding process produces much more finely ground particles than conventional milling methods. OGL cryo mills are able to grind many materials to 10µm average particle size or smaller. This improves the particle flow of polymers and dispersion potential for processed polymers and foodstuffs in liquid.

## Production of polymer particles below 5 μm by wet grinding 
Abstract Polymeric microparticles that may be used in rapid prototyping processes typically are produced by either polymerization processes or cryogenic grinding in impact mills at liquid nitrogen temperature (− 196 °C) or by dry grinding at solid carbon dioxide temperature (− 78 °C). Within this account an alternative approach for the production of polymer particles is presented.
