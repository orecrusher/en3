## Iron Mining In Minnesota 1800s
Most of the iron mines in Minnesota were close to Lake Superior less than one hundred miles away. Train would take the ore to docks to be loaded on ships. They then used the mined iron to make railroads buildings like skyscrapers cars bridges and many other things. The ore itself was found in Minnesota by a geologist in 1865.

The world will need iron ore for as long as the world needs steel. In 2020 we produced around 280 million tonnes of iron ore. That's enough to make the steel for more than 3300 Sydney Harbour Bridges. We're building a new iron ore mine in Western Australia. When completed South Flank will produce high-quality iron ore for around 25 years.

## Iron Ore Mining 
Haematite and magnetite are the most commonly found iron ore minerals. The smelting process allows the iron ore to be heated with carbon. The carbon combines with the oxygen and carries it away leaving behind iron. Blast furnaces are so hot which is why they melt the iron and drain it off to be poured into moulds to form bars called ingots.
