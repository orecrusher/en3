## Gold
 · The association of gold and copper mineralization in commercially viable ore is a common occurrence. At one end of the spectrum is the predominantly copper ore which contains levels of gold mineralization. This would be uneconomic to mine for its gold content but the gold provides a significant opportunity value.
