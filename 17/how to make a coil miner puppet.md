## Easy to build pulse induction metal detector with DSP 
For ideal damping of a 400µH coil a resistor of around 680Ω is used. Coils with an inductance of 300µH should be discharged over a 600Ω resistor. If we loaded the coil to a current of 2 Ampere it is not difficult to calculate with Ohm's law that with a 680Ω discharge resistor the voltage will peak to 1360 Volt.

One large coil is in the search head and a smaller coil is loed inside the control box. Each coil is connected to an oscillator that generates thousands of pulses of current per second. The frequency of these pulses is slightly offset between the two coils. As the pulses travel through each coil the coil generates radio waves.

Ludicrite block turbines are ludicrous. By using only 4 blocks of Ludicrite as the coil material and using a minimum of 76 blades setting the fluid intake to 1918 mB/t will make the turbine reach 13478.1 RPM and generate 26531 RF/t. It is even better than a optimal 1800 RPM design and is much cheaper.
