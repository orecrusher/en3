## Air quality management: a mining perspective
Mines can be classified as either underground mines or open pit mines. In some cases a combination of open pit and underground mining occurs although usually sequentially in the mine life-cycle rather than simultaneously. At underground mines the rock dumps tailings dams and load-out facilities are the main causes of dust emissions whereas

Mining is a major industry in PNG and very large open pits have been constructed with excavated slope heights ranging from 300 to 1000 m. Open pit mine slopes are designed with a serviceable life of no more than 10 to 20 years. As such predicted and well-managed failures or landslides are usually considered acceptable.

## Modeling of Accurate Variable Slope Angles in Open
In this paper a new method of modeling variable slope angles has been presented based on the spline interpolation method. Slope angle modeling and defining precedency of the blocks are the vital parts of almost any open pit optimization algorithm. Traditionally heuristic patterns such as 1:5 or 1:9 have been used to generate slope angles. Cone template based models were later employed in

Sublevel Open Stoping originated in the early 1900's in iron ore mines in Michigan USA. It was developed over the years from a method originally known as short hole bench and train mining.Generally a large scale open stoping method it is often referred to as long hole or blast hole stoping. A Typical Sublevel Open Stoping Operation.

## Improved Blasting and Bench Slope Design at the Aitik Mine
The Aitik open pit mine loed in northern Sweden currently faces a substantial production increase which has necessitated a review and update of design guidelines. This work pointed at the possibility of increasing interramp slope angles a few degrees which in turn requires an improved bench slope design most notably blasting techniques.

## Lerchs–Grossmann algorithm with variable slope angles 
 · Abstract. One of the most important design factors in open-pit mining is determination of the optimal pit. Pits may be redesigned many times during the life of a mine in response to changes in design parameters as more information is obtained and to changes in the values of technical and economic parameters.

## Heap leaching 
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals copper uranium and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re-separate them after their division from other earth materials. Similar to in situ mining heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner then adds the chemicals via drip systems to the
