## Copper mining. The main stages. 
Copper mining. The main stages. Copper minerals and ore are found throughout the Earth's crust. They occur in both sedimentary and igneous rocks. The outer 10km of the crust contains 33g of copper for every tonne of rock. This is not enough to make it commercially viable to extract the rock. Copper mines are only set up where there is more than

In most cases the thin-layer process was used where crushed ores (80% −0.5 in) were stacked in heaps of 3–8 m height after agglomeration and sprayed at flow rates of 6–40 L·hour −1 ·m −2 with 15–90 days duration for copper oxides and 10–18 months for sulfides. Of note 80%–85% copper extraction was commonly achieved.

Advantages of this process are: much less energy is use than in traditional mining no waste gases are given off it can be used on ores with as little as 0.1% copper - for this reason leaching extraction is growing in importance.

 · The simplest case may be represented by a low grade copper ore which in its natural state could not be economically shipped or smelted. The treatment of such an ore by flotation or some other process of concentration has this purpose: to concentrate the copper into as small a bulk as possible without losing too much of the copper in doing so.

## Geology of Copper 
 · Copper is found alongside many other types of ore. It can be found near gold silver zinc lead and other types of metal deposits. When mixed in with other ores copper is not usually found in great abundance. Until the development of the modern copper mining process it was typically a byproduct of mining for other metals.

 · Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper being further processed in a converter furnace. Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity. Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised

## purifiion of copper by electrolysis metal extraction 
Low grade ores only contain small concentrations of copper and would not normally be considered economic to mine and process as would waste material from processing high grade copper ores. These two methods avoid traditional mining methods of digging moving and disposing of large amounts of rock - they make finite copper resources last longer and reduce the impact on the environment.

Extract copper and gold from low-grade ores more efficiently. Ore deposits are becoming increasingly complex to treat and grades continue to deteriorate in known reserves. For instance approximately 15-20 per cent of the world's current gold production involves refractory ores that must be pre-treated prior to downstream recovery by cyanidation.

Extraction of Metals. Extraction of Copper.. Copper is sometimes found as native metal.. Copper ores include copper(II) oxide and copper(II) sulfide. Copper(II) oxide can be reduced by reaction with carbon.. Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper. These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so valuable.
