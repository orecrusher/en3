## 8 Asphalt Pavement Issues 
 · Potholes in asphalt are typically the end result of alligator cracking (also known as fatigue cracking.) As alligator cracking becomes severe the interconnected cracks create chunks of pavement which can be dislodged as vehicles drive over them. A pothole is what we call the hole that is left after the pavement chunk is dislodged.

 · Failure of flexible pavement. Cracking in the bituminous pavement is the most common distress. These cracks may be load associated (Bottom-Up cracks ) or Nonload associated (Top Down cracks ). In many cases we can identify the cause of cracks from the pattern of the cracks. Ingress of water through wide cracks is harmful to the pavement structure.
