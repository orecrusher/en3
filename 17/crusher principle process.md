## FAM – Crushers – Processing Technology
FAM designed crushers are used for crushing minerals raw materials and other bulk commodities.. The types of crushing machines are distinguished by their working principles: by pressure impact hammer or shear. In contrast to mills crushers process the feed materials into grain sizes from coarse to medium granulation.

 · When the Start flushing principle is used together with the manufacturing execution system it can also be used to flush materials when an operation or a process job is started. This principle is relevant if for example the variance in the consumption is low the materials are low-value materials there are no tracking requirements or there is a short run time on operations.
