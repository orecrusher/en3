## Study on conversion of dihydrate gypsum to hemihydrate 
Study on conversion of dihydrate gypsum to hemihydrate gypsum. Gypsum is a material with a long history of appliion. It is juxtaposed with lime and cement as the three pillars of inorganic cementitious materials. Depending on the preparation process α-type hemihydrate gypsum or β-type hemihydrate gypsum can be obtained.

Gypsum rock is mined or quarried crushed and ground into a fine powder. In a process called calcining the powder is heating to approximately 350 degrees F driving off three fourths of the chemically combined water. The calcined gypsum or hemihydrate becomes the base for gypsum plaster gypsum board and other gypsum products.

Without gypsum hydrated calcium aluminate crystallizes within about 10 min; gypsum retards this process by several hours or even days depending on the gypsum content. In the quality control of cement it is therefore important to know the exact content of the CaSO4 dihydrate or hemihydrate.

The Prayon HDH Process is a clever technology that maximizes the P 2 O 5 strength in the acid and produces a high-quality gypsum.. It consists of an attack of the phosphate rock under hemihydrate conditions. Hemihydrate slurry is filtered on a Prayon tilting pan filter to recover the phosphoric acid.
