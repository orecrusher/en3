## Iron Ore 
From 1915 to 1965 the Iron Monarch and Iron B-Iron Prince mines were the main supply of ore for Australia's iron and steel industry. The favourable logistics of low cost of ore extraction and the nearby portsite at Whyalla led BHP to establish an integrated steelworks at Whyalla in 1964.

 · BHP recorded a 3% year-on-year increase in revenues in 2019 driven by higher realised prices for iron ore petroleum and metallurgical coal. Higher sales from Western Australia Iron Ore mining operations also contributed to the increase in revenues while also partially offsetting the lower average realised prices for copper and thermal coal.

Emission intensities are on iron ore production basis Intensities are calculated at each mine by dividing total Scope 1 2 emissions by total iron ore production including all product types (fines and lumps). Emissions from pellet plants are pro-rated to applicable % of mine production for partially integrated assets and included in Scope 1 2.
