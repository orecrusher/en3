## Introduction to Mineral Processing or Beneficiation
 · 1.3 Run-Of-Mine Material and Minerals. Generally mineral processing begins when an ore is delivered from a mine to a processing facility. At this point the ore is called run-of-mine material because there has been no treatment performed on it. There are three primary types of run-of-mine materials: Run-of-mine consisting of useful materials.

 · The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 – 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size. The large balls tend to break down the coarse feed materials and the smaller balls help to form fine product by reducing void spaces between the balls. Ball mills grind material by impact and attrition.
