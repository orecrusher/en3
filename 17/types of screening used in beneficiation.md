Beneficiation The fast movement of the slurry causes it to bang against the pipes and this breaks apart any clay balls. What arrives at the beneficiation plant are fine-grained sand clay and phosphate sediments suspended in water. At the beneficiation plant the slurry is first run through a screen which filters out the coarser sand.

## Mechanical screening 
Mechanical screening often just called screening is the practice of taking granulated ore material and separating it into multiple grades by particle size.. This practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and mineral processing agriculture pharmaceutical food plastics and recycling.. A method of separating solid particles according to size alone is called screening.

## Ore Beneficiation 
Screening is an important step for dry beneficiation of iron ore. Crushing and screening is typically the first step of iron ore beneficiation processes. In most ores including iron ore valuable minerals are usually intergrown with gangue minerals so the minerals need to be separated in order to be liberated.

## Review on Beneficiation Techniques and Reagents Used for 
Many beneficiation techniques can be employed to upgrade the P2O5 grade of phosphate ores based on their characteristics in chemical composition and texture. The flotation process is most widely applied to balance the P2O5 recovery ratio and cost. In this review the dominant techniques for the beneficiation of phosphate ores are introduced.

When this type of beneficiation uses repelling force it is normally employed to change the trajectory of falling objects to sort them into different places. This way when a mixture of particles falls past a repelling object the particles with the correct charge fall away from the other particles when they are repelled by the similarly charged object.
