## Which Type of Crusher is Suitable for Processing Granite 
 · Two or more crusher types will be used in the granite crushing process so the combination of crusher is especially important. A good production line will make the crushing process run more smoothly and save labor power and material resources while increasing production. 4. Dust The crushing of ore cannot avoid the generation of dust.

## 5. Processing 
 · Consequently the process plant may frequently also contain pumping and slurry handling equipment and unit processes of solid-liquid separation for final dewatering of the aggregate products and even waste products. Mineral separation processes are occasionally employed to reject material of undesirable physical or chemical properties.
