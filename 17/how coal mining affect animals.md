## Coal and Water Pollution 
 · Coal mining. Mining operations can negatively impact water supplies often with long-lasting effects. The fundamental issue involves contamination of nearby rivers lakes and aquifers by what comes out of a coal mine—usually highly acidic water containing heavy metals like arsenic copper and lead. The process is known as acid mine drainage.

Early coal miners also worked close to the surface often in horizontal drift mines which meant that work was not as dangerous in the era before deep shaft mining. Most mining operations were far-flung enterprises away from urban centers which frustrated attempts to organize miners into a "critical mass" of collective power — even in the nation's most developed anthracite fields.
