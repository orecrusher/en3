## Main Properties of Concrete for Construction 
Concrete is a mixture of several materials. At the hardened state this heterogeneous material becomes stone-like mass. The extensive use of concrete in the construction field has made it a material of huge concern for engineers. To participate in the vast uses of concrete an engineer must know its properties.

## Definition of Concrete MPa 
Concrete is a building material made from a mixture of cement water sand and gravel. Known for its strength and durability concrete is used to construct buildings bridges and roadways. To ensure a concrete structure will last inspectors test the strength of the concrete once it has had time to dry.
