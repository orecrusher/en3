 · Subsidence resulting from mining has caused widespread damage in many parts of the United States. In the Greater Kansas City metropolitan area in the Midwestern United States century-old mining of Pennsylvanian age limestone by room-and-pillar method has left behind numerous mine openings of various sizes many of which progressively deteriorate resulting in subsidence.

## Respirable Dust Hazards in Open Pit
 · The excavation can run deep but unlike underground mining the activities take place in the open air. That eliminates or reduces some of the risks involved in mining. But working in the open air doesn't mean that workers can breathe easily. Open pit mining produces large quantities of dust which is a significant hazard in and of itself.

## how does a limestone quarry harm the environment
 · Limestone mining can pollute water and create sinkholes. When limestone dissolves while it''s still in the ground caves and gullies form a natural phenomenon known as karst. Although this doesn''t hurt the environment in its natural form once the limestone is mined out sinkholes can form and disrupt underground waterways.
