Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock boulders cobbles or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases soil-cement and in new concrete. After harvesting aggregate is processed: crushed screened and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.
