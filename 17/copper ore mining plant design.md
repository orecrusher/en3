Beginning in the mid 1980s a new technology commonly known as the leach-solvent extraction-electrowinning process or SX/EW Process was widely adopted. This new copper technology utilizes smelter acid to produce copper from oxidized ores and mine wastes. Today worldwide approximately 20% of all copper produced is produced by this is process.
