## Understanding Centrifugal Pump and Motor Torque
 · To overcome pump inertia and static friction approximately 20% of full load torque is required. As the pump's speed increases the required torque gradually declines. For example at about 15% full load speed the required torque typically is around 5% or 10% full load torque. As shown below the pump torque-speed curve follows the square law:
