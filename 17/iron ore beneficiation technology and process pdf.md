Ray Hawk Raw iron ore has to be purified for use. Iron ore beneficiation is a multi-stage process that raw iron ore undergoes to purify it prior to the process of smelting which involves melting the ore to remove the metal content.The process of iron ore beneficiation has two complementary goals and these define the methods used to refine it.
