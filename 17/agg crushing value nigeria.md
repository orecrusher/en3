## Aggregate Crushing Value Test 
Aggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load. Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions.

It is recommended that the crushing value of aggregate should be less than 30%. If it is more than 30 % then 10% finer aggregate is suggested to use. The aggregate whose crushing value is less than 30% can be used for cement concrete road. The aggregate whose crushing value is less than 40% can be used for wearing surface.

## Methods for determination of aggregate crushing value (ACV 
the aggregate crushing value (ACV) which gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. The method is applicable to aggregates passing a 14.0 mm test sieve and retained on a 10.0 mm test sieve. For other size fractions there is another recommended method.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test – Determine Aggregate 
 · Aggregates with lower crushing value show a lower crushed fraction under load and would give a longer service life to the road and hence a more economical performance. If we used a weaker would get crushed under traffic loads would produce smaller pieces not coated with a binder and these would be easily displaced or loosened out resulting in loss of the surface/layer.
