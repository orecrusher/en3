## Knowing the Basics Leads to Better Care
3 Crusher Bearings: Knowing the Basics Leads to Better Care Impact Crushers Secondary crushing circuits commonly use hammer mills and vertical and horizontal impact crushers and experience high-rotational speeds and variable loading conditions. They tend to use spherical roller bearings for lexibility and to accommodate misalignment.

## Cone Crusher 
 · Cone crusher and gyratory crusher work on the same principle. Both have the same operation. If cone crusher differs then it is only from crushing chamber. Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones. It breaks the rocks by squeezing it between the gyrating spindles.

## Cone Crusher 
Cone crushers were originally designed and developed by around 1920 and therefore are often described as cone crushers. As the mechanisms of crushing in these crushers are similar to gyratory crushers their designs are similar but in this case the spindle is supported at the bottom of the gyrating cone instead of being suspended as in larger gyratory crushers.
