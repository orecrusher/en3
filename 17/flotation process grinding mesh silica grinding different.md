## AMIT 145: Lesson 5 Froth Flotation – Mining Mill Operator 
AMIT 145: Lesson 5 Froth Flotation. Froth flotation is a physico-chemical separation process. Separation is principally based on differences in surface hydrophobicity. However particle size and density have a significant impact. Initial flotation patent and appliion was developed for graphite by the Bessel brothers (1877).

In this work we study the froth flotation process of chalcopyrite with emphasis on the influence of the presence of sludges and clays into the pulp during flotation. For this purpose the chalcopyrite was mechanically prepared (crushing and grinding) the material was classified (between mesh 100 and 120 and the particle sizes were measured).

While most grinding in the mineral industry is achieved using devices containing a steel grinding medium the IsaMill uses inert grinding media such as silica sand waste smelter slag or ceramic balls. The use of steel grinding media can cause problems in the subsequent flotation processes that are used to separate the various minerals in an ore because the iron from the grinding medium can
