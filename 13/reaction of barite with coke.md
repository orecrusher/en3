 · Mixing cocaine with an opioid drug can be extremely dangerous. Still this drug often combined with cocaine to produce what users call a speedball. Using them together is a practice known as speedballing. Because cocaine is a stimulant and heroin is a depressant this creates a kind of "push-pull" effect in the body and brain.

First published on 25th June 2014. A packed bed microbalance reactor setup (TEOM-GC) is used to investigate the formation of coke as a function of time-on-stream on γ-Al 2 O 3 and 3P/SiO 2 alyst samples under different conditions for the ODH reaction of ethylbenzene to styrene. All samples show a linear correlation of the styrene selectivity and yield with the initial coverage of coke.
