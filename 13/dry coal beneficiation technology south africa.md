## Dry Processing Versus Dense Medium Processing For 
Thermal Coal GJ de Korte CSIR Pretoria South Africa jdekortecsir ABSTRACT Dense medium processing is the beneficiation process most widely employed in South Africa. Based on the fact that South Africa (and its neighboring countries) is a water-scarce area dry processing technologies are being evaluated for implementation in the region.

## Dry processing versus dense medium processing for 
Dense medium processing is the beneficiation process most widely employed in South Africa. Based on the fact that South Africa (and its neighboring countries) is a water-scarce area dry processing technologies are being evaluated for implementation in the region. In addition to not requiring water the technique is less expensive than dense medium processing both in terms of capital cost and

## The dry beneficiation of duff coal in a dense medium 
Traditionally wet beneficiation is the predominant method in order to beneficiate coal due to its sharp separation efficiency; however large quantities of water are required in order to process the coal. Water scarcity especially in arid coal rich countries is therefore encouraging the development of dry coal beneficiation technologies.
