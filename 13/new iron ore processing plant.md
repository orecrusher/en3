 · In a DRI furnace the iron ore is heated but not to the point of melting. Hydrogen then passes over the hot ore combining with oxygen liberated from the iron oxide to form water and leaving relatively pure iron behind. Typically that still-hot iron is then transferred to an electric furnace for additional processing to turn it into steel.
