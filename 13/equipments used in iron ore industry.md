Smelting Furnace of Iron Ore Laboratory-scale experiments showed that pig irons and steels of acceptable grade can be made by arc-furnace methods from east Texas siliceous ores containing less than 25 percent iron. Under highly reducing conditions 97 to 99 percent of the iron in the ore was recovered as pig iron. Small quantities of limestone the minimum limited only by progressively higher
