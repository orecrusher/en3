Coal is mined either by surface methods (open-cut or open-cast mining) or by underground techniques. In surface mining all of the rock from the ground surface to the top of the seam (material referred to as overburden) is removed and set aside to expose the coal which is then taken out and transported from the mine for preparation and use .

## Australian mining 
 · Coal mining methods. In contrast to most global production the majority of black coal mined in Australia is produced from open-cut (open cast) mines. This ratio of 3:1 open-cut/surface to underground mines also applies to the broader (i.e. non-coal) local mining sector.

Open-pit mining or open-cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth such as long wall mining. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful minerals or rocks are found near the surface; that is

## Basics of an open pit mine 
Open pit mines can be used in coal mining and they are used extensively in "hard rock" mining for ores such as metal ores copper gold iron aluminum and many minerals. In a open pit coal mine the pit bottom would be the bottom mined coal seam elevation since it is usually feasible to extract multiple seams when surface mining coal.
