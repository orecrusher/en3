The mining of minerals in Nigeria accounts for only 0.3% of its gross domestic product due to the influence of its vast oil resources. The domestic mining industry is underdeveloped leading to Nigeria having to import minerals that it could produce domestically such as salt or iron ore.Rights to ownership of mineral resources is held by the Federal government of Nigeria which grants titles

Sand can be found all over the places; in the shores of large natural lakes seas oceans and also in rivers. It can only be taken out by pit mining or what we call quarrying. As what Florence stated (2014) Quarrying is an activity where stones are dug for the purpose of being used in industrial including construction and agriculture.
