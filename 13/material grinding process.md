## Machining 
Machining is a term used to describe a variety of material removal processes in which a cutting tool removes unwanted material from a workpiece to produce the desired shape. The workpiece is typically cut from a larger piece of stock which is available in a variety of standard shapes such as flat sheets solid bars hollow tubes and shaped beams.
