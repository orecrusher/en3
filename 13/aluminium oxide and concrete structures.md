So aluminum oxide as a whole is a powerful oxidizing agent. This cause materials to get rusted and finally get deteriorated.henceeven the normal properties of cement are deteriorated by excess aluminum oxide. This leads to weakeening in strength of cement.

## Blast Off: Choosing The Best Sandblasting Media For Rust 
 · Aluminium oxide. Aluminium oxide is one of the gentlest medias around and small-scale versions of aluminium oxide blasters are even used by some skin clinics for dermabrasion treatments. Despite this soft touch however aluminium oxide is more than capable of removing relatively thin coatings of rust on metal components.

## Mechanical properties of an iron oxide formed by corrosion 
 · Being a granular material the iron oxide mechanical properties are supposed to depend strongly on the confinement. Moreover around the corroded rebar the oxide is confined between concrete and steel: this state can be assimilated to an oedometric one where the tangential and axial expansions are blocked by the symmetry of the problem.

## Does concrete corrode aluminum ? 
 · In most situations the contact time between aluminum and fresh concrete is relatively short so it normally doesn't cause a problem. Therefore you can use an aluminum truck bed to haul concrete for a short duration without any adverse effect as along as it's cleaned after use.
