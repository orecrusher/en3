## transformation of coal and types of coal
Coal is a fossil fuel that is essentially "the altered remains of prehistoric vegetation" as the World Coal Association (WCA) puts it. However there are a number of different coal types. Coal originally began to form during the Carboniferous period which took place between 360 and 290 million years ago.

## How Does a Coal Power Plant Work? 
 · Thermal-based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources. The coal-fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption. Coal fired power plants while producing power require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2.

## Coal 
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements chiefly hydrogen sulfur oxygen and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.
