Magnetic storage is a storage medium commonly used for large volumes of data (e.g. video image or remote sensing data). Magnetic tape drives use magnetic tape to store the data. Large amounts of data are stored through tape drives because the capacity on the drives is huge – three billion (or three gigabits) of data per square inch can fit on a single magnetic disk.
