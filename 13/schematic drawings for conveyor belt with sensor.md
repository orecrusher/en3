Sensor loops are sensitive parts which may trigger off false alarm. Also if high grade iron ore like magnetite with very strong ferromagnetic properties is being conveyed the rip detection system may not work properly. Sensor loops do by far not achieve the operational lifetime of the conveyor belt.
