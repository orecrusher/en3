## Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) 
Precipitated Calcium Carbonate. PCC stands for Precipitated Calcium Carbonate—also known as purified refined or synthetic calcium carbonate. It has the same chemical formula as other types of calcium carbonate such as limestone marble and chalk: CaCO3. The calcium carbon and oxygen atoms can arrange themselves in three different ways to form three different calcium carbonate
