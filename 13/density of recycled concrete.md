## Recycled Concrete Aggregates: A Review 
 · After demolition of old roads and buildings the removed concrete is often considered worthless and disposed of as demolition waste. By collecting the used concrete and breaking it up recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is created (Fig. 1).This paper focuses on coarse RCA which is the coarse aggregate from the original concrete that is created after the mortar is separated from the rock

## Use of Recycled Concrete 
Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is generally produced by the crushing of concrete rubble screening then removal of contaminants such as reinforcement paper wood plastics and gypsum. Concrete made with such recycled concrete aggregate is called recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) (Wagih et al. 2013).

## Why How to Use Recycled Crushed Concrete 
 · What is Recycled Concrete Aggregate? Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) — also called "crushed concrete" — is made up of asphalt debris from other construction projects that can be reused to create driveways pathways garden beds and more.. When any concrete structure road sidewalk or parking lot is destroyed that concrete is often deposited in a landfill.

 · The weight/density of 82 pcf could be accurate for that sample. Large (4" -6") pieces of concrete are generally cubical and angular. The in-place density depends on the size and shape of the individual particles. Large pieces with no fines will give you a very low density (pcf) unless you have the optimum amount of fines of the correct gradation.

I've seen this in soil-cement crushed recycled concrete and cement-treated base materials. This is particularly true when a nuclear density gage is used.
