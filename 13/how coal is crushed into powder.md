coal has been reduced to the desired fine powder. Some power stations crush coal into fine dust in pulverising mills. These mills work by repeatedly dropping massive steel balls on to the coal until it is crushed into fine coal dust. The steel balls used at Drax for example are hollow about 73 cm in diameter and weigh 1.4 tonnes each.
