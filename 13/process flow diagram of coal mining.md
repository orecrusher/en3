It is a process flow diagram of the coal cleaning operations at the Georgetown plant. This coal preparation plant was opened in 1951 and was one of the largest preparation plants in the world. Several sizes of coal were produced here including hand-picked +7" Lump (when needed) and the plant could process 1275 TPH of clean coal - a big deal in the 1950's.

As shown in the process flow diagram the coal is first slurried with water and fed to the first stage of the gasifier. Oxygen with a purity of 95% is provided from the Air Separation Unit (ASU) and the coal is partially combusted to maintain a temperature of 1370 °C. Raw fuel gas is produced as the coal chemically reacts with oxygen and steam.

Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa a coal mine and its structures are a colliery a coal mine is called a 'pit

## A System Dynamics Model for Ecological Environmental 
 · in coal mining areas has become an urgent problem to be solved. In recent years researches on ecological environmental management in coal mining areas have become a very popular project for scholars to deal with. In one branch for a review of the literature on policies of ecological environmental management in coal mining areas see [3–7].

## 4 Coal Mining and Processing 
 · The overall coal mining process consists of several sequential stages: (1) exploration of a potentially economic coal seam to assess minable reserves environmental issues marketable reserves potential markets and permitting risks; (2) analysis and selection of a mining plan; (3) securing the markets; (4) developing the mine; (5) extracting the coal; (6) processing the coal if necessary

A flow diagram of a 400 ton per hour coal plant that produces both metallurgical coal and steam coal for power generation. Generally speaking metallurgical coal is cleaner has higher carbon content and is easier to process than the lower rank steam coals. At this prep plant all feed coal (ROM) is crushed to -2" before entering the plant

## How is coal seam gas extracted? 
The process depressurises the coal seam allowing the gas in the pores of the coal to be released and flow to the surface. The gas and liquid are brought to the surface via a pipe which is encased in layers of concrete and metal to prevent any leakage into permeable layers including aquifers. On the surface the gas is separated from the water.

## 12.3. Types of Coal
The processes for production of specific chemicals from coal are typically proprietary systems using specialized process systems. In the following discussion some of the processes for important chemicals such as formaldehyde olefins etc. are presented. Methanol (MeOH) is of course another important primary chemical made from coal syngas; however it is also a liquid fuel in its own right

## Mineral Processing 
Mineral processing mineral beneficiation or upgradation involves handling three primary types of ROM material which have been blasted fragmented and brought out from an in situ position. These materials can be used directly or by simple or complex processing and even by applying extractive metallurgy like hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical methods.
