## 25.3 Crushing and milling 
Coal found in sedimentary rock is crushed into the appropriate size and used as fuel for electricity generation or the iron-making process. Lumps of coal can be used directly as a fuel. However some coal is first washed to make it into 'high grade coal'. It can also be sorted into various sizes depending on what the fuel is required for.

 · Grinding the final stage used in the comminution process is usually conducted in cylindrical tumbling mills where the particle size is reduced through a combination of impact and abrasion. The primary differences between these mills are in the ratio of diameter to the length of the cylinder and the type of grinding media employed.

Continuous Casting Process. The final stage of producing steel is the C ontinuous Casting Process where steel is forged into various steel products.. Hot Rolled Product – When a slab is heated above 1100 degree Celsius and passed between rollers it turns into a thin and long sheet (hot rolled).This hot rolled product is widely used as a construction material and pipes in various industries.

## Nuclear Fuel Cycle Overview 
The nuclear fuel cycle: industrial processes which involve the production of electricity from uranium in nuclear power reactors. Electricity is created by using the heat generated in a nuclear reactor to produce steam and drive a turbine connected to a generator. Fuel removed from a reactor after it has reached the end of its useful life can be reprocessed to produce new fuel.

Coal is a solid black readily combustible fossil fuel that contains a large amount of carbon-based material - approximately 50% of its weight. The formation of coal takes a significant amount of time (on the order of a few million years) and the first coal-bearing rock units appeared about million years ago at a time known as the Carboniferous or "coal-bearing" Period.
