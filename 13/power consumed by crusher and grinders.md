## Comminution 
Comminution is the reduction of solid materials from one average particle size to a smaller average particle size by crushing grinding cutting vibrating or other processes. In geology it occurs naturally during faulting in the upper part of the Earth's crust. In industry it is an important unit operation in mineral processing ceramics electronics and other fields accomplished with

Size reduction is applied to all the ways in which solids are cut or broken into smaller pieces. Energy consumed in crushing is determined by three laws: Kick's law Rittenger's law and Bond's law. Energy required to affect a small change "dL" in the size of the unit mass of the material is simple power
