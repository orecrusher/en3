 · Agglomerate quality. For these reasons agglomeration can greatly improve ore recovery rates in a heap leaching operation. As has been demonstrated however the quality of the agglomerates is critical to maximizing recovery. Many factors influence agglomerate characteristics including drum rpms ore moisture content feed rates and retention time.
