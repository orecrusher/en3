## Controlling the Conveyor Speed 
Faster belt speeds help the SURF RAKE remove smaller material while slower belt speeds are optimal for removing large bulky material. The speed of the conveyor belt is directly tied to the speed of the PTO shaft and engine. Therefore as the tractor engine's RPM or revolutions per minute increase the conveyor speed will increase as well.

## Motor Speeds Explained: Diving into AC and DC Motors 
Two pole AC motors operating at 60 Hz will always run at approximately 3600 rpm and four pole AC motors will have speeds around 1800 rpm. Speed = 120 x frequency (Hz) / poles of the motor. Example 120 x 60 hertz / 4 poles = 1800 rpm. Keep in mind that the speed of an AC motor will not run at these exact numbers—and will be slightly lower
