When the 1969 Coal Mine Health and Safety Act was enacted U.S. coal production was about 600 million tons with about 60 percent underground mining and 40 percent surface mining. Longwall mining accounted for less than 1 percent of the underground production; room-and-pillar continuous mining accounted for about 50 percent of the underground production.
