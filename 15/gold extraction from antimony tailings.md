 · At 10% pulp density the optimal conditions for bio-oxidation were pH 1.75 5.0 g/L Fe 2＋ and this resulted in 86% gold extraction from both concentrate and flotation tailings. The results demonstrated the efficiency of bio-oxidation as a pre-treatment as the gold extraction was only 21% for the as-received material samples.
