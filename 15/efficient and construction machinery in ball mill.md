## The operating principle of the ball mill
 · The disadvantages of ball mills include their considerable metal consumption and deterioration grinding media as well as a lot of noise. Most of the energy useless lost during ball mill operation leading to low it efficiency. But even a significant specific energy consumption for grinding material compensates beneficial effect by using mill.

## Ball Mill 
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

 · Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis. Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed the overall removal is quite brisk.
