## How Does Limestone Affect the Environment?
 · Limestone mining can pollute water and create sinkholes. When limestone dissolves while it's still in the ground caves and gullies form a natural phenomenon known as karst. Although this doesn't hurt the environment in its natural form once the limestone is mined out sinkholes can form and disrupt underground waterways.
