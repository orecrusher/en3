## Will Gypsum Improve Clay Soil? 
 · Gypsum Improves the Structure of Clay. In sodic soil the sodium ions disrupt the clay structure. The soil drains poorly is sticky when wet hard when dry and contains very little air for plant roots. In such a situation the calcium in gypsum knocks the sodium ions off the clay and replaces them with calcium ions.
