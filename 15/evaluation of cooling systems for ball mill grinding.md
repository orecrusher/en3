## Effect of grinding method on the analysis of essential oil 
 · The grinding with the knife mill without cooling and planetary ball mill allowed an increase in the temperature of plant material which was measured immediately after opening of mills. The highest increase on plant temperature after grinding was observed for knife mill without cooling that reached 32.1 ± 1.2 °C which is more than two times the initial temperature measured before grinding

The actual dispersion system in a bead mill consists of a milling chamber and an agitator; the milling chamber is filled with the grinding beads (material e.g. glass zircon oxide steel) and the product to be dispersed. In the milling vessel the grinding medium is kept moving by the agitator which itself is driven by a motor.

## Back to Basics Hammer Milling and Jet Milling Fundamentals
Liquid nitrogen is often used to cool the feed stream in hammer mills for grinding tough materials. However liquid nitrogen is seldom used in jet milling opera-tions due to the swift heat exchange between the material and the grinding gas. The grinding gas heats up the super-cooled feed stream and the material loses its brittleness
