## How to Achieve Uniform Sinter Quality 
 · Sinter is the primary feed material for making iron in a blast furnace. During the iron ore sintering process in iron and steel manufacturing sinter is created by mixing iron ore concentrate with several additives such as limestone and silica to control the chemistry and then igniting it at 1200°C in a continuous belt-fed furnace. The production of high-quality sinter is crucial for assuring

## Iron ore 
The world will need iron ore for as long as the world needs steel. In 2020 we produced around 280 million tonnes of iron ore. That's enough to make the steel for more than 3300 Sydney Harbour Bridges. We're building a new iron ore mine in Western Australia. When completed South Flank will produce high-quality iron ore for around 25 years.

## Sintering: A Step Between Mining Iron Ore and Steelmaking
 · Sinter quality begins with the mined iron ore and the proper selection and mixing of the raw materials. Inhomogeneous raw mix can affect permeability and cause an increase in fuel consumption. During the iron ore sintering process in iron and steel manufacturing an online analyzer can be used to determine the elemental composition of the bulk raw materials in sinter feed.

A sinter feed with good permeability from ignition until burn-through is required for efficient operation of a sinter plant. In this regard it is necessary to consider the widely held and simplistic view that sinter feeds containing iron ores with high ultra-fines content have low-pre-ignition permeability.

## Iron Ore Statistics and Information 
Iron Ore Statistics and Information. Iron ore is a mineral substance which when heated in the presence of a reductant will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel
