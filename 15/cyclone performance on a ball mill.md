Ball Mill Operation. Ball mills ride on steel tires or supported on both ends by trunnions. Girth gears bolted to the shell drive the mill through a pinion shaft from a prime mover drive. The prime movers are usually synchronized motors. During rotation a portion of the charge is lifted along the inside perimeter.

## Ball Mills 
Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills they must be operated in a closed system with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced. Various classifiers such as screens spiral
