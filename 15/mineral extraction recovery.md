## What is the Difference between Primary Secondary 
 · Primary oil recovery refers to the process of extracting oil either via the natural rise of hydrocarbons to the surface of the earth or via pump jacks and other artificial lift devices. Since this technique only targets the oil which is either susceptible to its release or accessible to the pump jack this is very limited in its extraction potential.

## Gold Extraction Recovery Processes
 · Perhaps one of the greatest challenges in the gold mining industry is to produce high grade concentrates consistently at maximum recovery from the mineralized deposit. To quantify recovery is a reasonable idea of the initial ore required to have an economical operation. In this part a reliable sampling representing the ore is a key aspect.
