## Extraction Process of Aluminium from Bauxite Ore
 · Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust and is a constituent of many minerals. However the material which is highest in aluminum and most free from objectionable impurities is bauxite which therefore is practically the only source of the metal under present processes.. Bauxite is the general name given to the hydrated oxides of aluminum.
