## Why Cement Producers Need to Embrace Industry 4.0
 · Industry 4.0 digital innovations from advanced data analytics to intelligent networks offer tremendous opportunity to create value and raise the efficiency of production processes. Yet few cement producers have implemented 4.0 advances in any systematic way. Producers that move quickly to employ 4.0 technologies can therefore gain a powerful competitive advantage over their peers.
