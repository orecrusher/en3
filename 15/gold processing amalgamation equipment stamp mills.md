 · A mercury-gold amalgam then is formed because gold will dissolve in the mercury while other impurities will not. The mixture of gold and mercury is then heated to a temperature that will vaporize the mercury leaving behind the gold. This process does not result in gold that is 100% pure but it does eliminate the bulk of the impurities.
