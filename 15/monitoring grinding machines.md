## Important to monitor performance in production lines 
 · When monitoring the movement of the production line you might see that the machine spends a lot of time waiting for the machine leading up to it. Thus the machine spends time in a starved state. Another scenario could be that the machine performing poorly actually works perfectly but it is the machine after that is in trouble.

## Grinding burn 
Grinding burn is preventable by using a coolant jet stream with 30-50% of the circumferential speed of the grinding wheel. Needle nozzles (pdf) by Grindaix apply this and efficiently prevent grinding burn on ground parts. It is important to know the pressure directly before the needle nozzle resulting in what coolant exit speeds and coolant
