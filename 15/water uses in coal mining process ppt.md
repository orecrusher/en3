## Environment Impact Assessment of Coal Mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting the coal from the deep underground mines in the earth crust. Coal mining is one of the most illegal activities going on in the country. At the same time it totally neglects the role of EIA in its pre-operational during mining and post operational plans.

Mine water. Water is used in many mining processes. Large volumes of water are used in some processes i.e. milling. In a mine process water is a valuable resource and is often recycled and re-used. Eventually the water is collected and released to the environment. Sometimes the water must be treated in different ways before it can be released.
