## Introduction to Phosphorus Removal Study Guide
In the aerobic zone PAOs use PHA as a source of carbon and energy for metabolism and cell growth. PAOs will also restore their supplies of glycogen and poly-phosphate in the aerobic zone. To replenish their stored poly-phosphate PAOs will take up excess phosphate from the mixed liquor which is the mechanism of biological phosphorus removal.

The phosphorus cycle originates in sediments. Sediments are the primary inorganic reservoir for phosphorus. Unlike that of the nitrogen and carbon cycles whose main reservoir is the atmosphere. Natural inorganic phosphorus occurs as phosphate in the mineral apatite. This mineral is often found in igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.
