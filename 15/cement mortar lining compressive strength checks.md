## compressive strength of the mortar lining
For ASTM C90 concrete block the assembly compressive strength only increases 250 psi when the mortar is changed from Type N to Type S (from an f'm of 1750 psi to 2000 psi for CMU units with 2000 psi compressive strength). The compressive strength of the masonry units is the largest factor by far in masonry assembly compressive strength.

Strength is the most important property of cement. The compressive strength test of cement is done because with an increase in compressive strength of cement strengths such as flexural strength resistance to abrasion and so on also increases.With one test we can determine various aspects of cement and can decide the suitable types of cement for the construction site.
