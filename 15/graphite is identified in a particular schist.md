## Schist 
Schist is a strongly foliated medium-grade metamorphic rock. It is characterized by an abundance of platy or elongated minerals (micas chlorite talc graphite amphiboles) in a preferred orientation.Varieties of this rock type share similarities in appearance (schistosity) but may be highly variable in composition.

## Metamorphic Rock Types: Pictures and Descriptions
 · Schist is a metamorphic rock that comes in almost infinite variety but its main characteristic is hinted at in its name: Schist comes from the ancient Greek for "split" through Latin and French. It is formed by dynamic metamorphism at high temperatures and high pressures that aligns the grains of mica hornblende and other flat or elongated minerals into thin layers or foliation.

Schist (/ ʃ ɪ s t / shist) is a medium-grained metamorphic rock showing pronounced schistosity.This means that the rock is composed of mineral grains easily seen with a low-power hand lens oriented in such a way that the rock is easily split into thin flakes or plates.This texture reflects a high content of platy minerals such as micas talc chlorite or graphite.

Schist (/ ʃ ɪ s t / shist) is a medium-grade metamorphic rock formed from mudstone or shale. Schist has medium to large flat sheet-like grains in a preferred orientation (nearby grains are roughly parallel). It is defined by having more than 50% platy and elongated minerals (such as micas or talc) often finely interleaved with quartz and feldspar.

## Schist 
 · Schist. Schist is a metamorphic rock consisting of mineral grains that are more or less aligned in layers. Because of this structure schist tends to cleave into flakes or slabs. The parent rock of a schist may be igneous (e.g. basalt granite syenite) or sedimentary (e.g. sandstone mudstone impure limestone).The metamorphic grade of a schist depends on how thoroughly melted and

 · Of particular note is that the graphite has been identified as high grade flake graphite with the potential to be chemically converted into graphene. Due to the highly friable/'soft' nature of the host graphitic schist it is rarely seen in outcrop although the prospective stratigraphy could be accurately traced using airborne and ground electromagnetic (EM) geophysical methods.
