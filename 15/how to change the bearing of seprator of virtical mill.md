 · Step 5. Select a vessel size that satisfies gas capacity water-drop removal and liquid-retention time requirements. An 84-in. × 13.4-ft separator satisfies the requirements so you would round up to an 84-in. × 13.5-ft vessel. Similarly a 90-in. × 12.5-ft separator would also be satisfactory.

## Achieving Efficient pulp washing 
 · Most mills operate on a multi-stage counter-current washing process allowing the mill to minimize the use of fresh water while increasing the concentration of black liquor going to the evaporators. Basically this consists of a sequence in which the cleanest wash water is applied to the last stage of the process which has the cleanest pulp.
