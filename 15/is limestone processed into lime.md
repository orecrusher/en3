## How Is Limestone Processed Into Lime
How Lime Is Produced. Therefore processed limestone is transported by conveyor belt to lime kilns and heated in higher temperatures. Calcining The fuel is burned in the preheated area from the cooler ones and as the limestone moves down the kiln the emit heat from fuel turns the limestone into quicklime and carbon dioxide CO2.

Lime in the Sugar Industry. Hydrated lime is essential to the production of sugar from both sugar cane and sugar beets. It is also used to purify sugar derived from other sources such as maple or sorghum. Sugar cane and sugar beets are harvested and processed with water to form raw juice which has low pH and contains dissolved impurities.

## How Lime is Produced 
Limestone is fed from the upper end of the kiln meanwhile fuel and combustion air are blown by fire from the lower end. Preheated limestone moves through the kiln and it is calcined into lime which ultimately discharges from the kiln into a cooler area. Generally shaft kilns consume relatively low amounts of heat due to their sealing and ability to efficiently transfer heat between gases and stones in
