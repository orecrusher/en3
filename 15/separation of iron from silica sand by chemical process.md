## Extraction of Iron Concentration of Ore 
 · The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.
