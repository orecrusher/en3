## Corrosion of Embedded Materials 
In reinforced concrete the rebar may have many separate areas at different energy levels. Concrete acts as the electrolyte and the metallic connection is provided by wire ties chair supports or the rebar itself. Corrosion is an electrochemical process involving the flow of charges (electrons and ions).
