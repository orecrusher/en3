Acetylene was discovered in 1836 when Edmund Davy was experimenting with potassium carbide. One of his chemical reactions produced a flammable gas which is now known as acetylene. In 1859 Marcel Morren successfully generated acetylene when he used carbon electrodes to strike an electric arc in an atmosphere of hydrogen.

## Acetylene Engines 
"ACETYLENE GAS ENGINES" "Until recently it has not been practical to use acetylene for gas engines owing to the fact that but very few acetylene generators generate acetylene at a temperature low enough to obtain a purity of gas or quantity sufficient to bring about the practical use of acetylene in an engine but there are some generators producing acetylene of a sufficiently low degree of
