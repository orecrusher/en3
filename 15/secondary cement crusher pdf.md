However in special concrete such as High Strength Concrete (HSC) and High Performance Concrete (HPC) where the water/cement ratio is low and high content of cement constitute their characteristics the bulk compressive load is borne by the aggregate. Therefore the failure in such concrete is mostly through the aggregate.

Earlier a typical crushing system used to be a two stage crushing with primary crusher in stage 1 (mostly jaw crusher) and hammer crusher in stage 2. This configuration was typically to suit ball mill appliions for grinding. Moreover the high capacity crushers for size reduction in single stage were not easily available at affordable costs.
