## The Role of Calcium in the Human Body
Calcium is a mineral and so it cannot be produced by the body. Therefore consuming adequate levels of calcium is crucial. The body needs a constant supply of calcium from diet to keep bones growing and strong. Bone remodelling is an ongoing process in which bone is broken down and calcium is deposited to replace the bone material that is lost.
