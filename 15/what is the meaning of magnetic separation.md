## Magnetic separation 
 · Magnetic drum separators are important magnetic separators that removes ferrous metal from dry bulk products in free-flowing processing systems. They are self cleaning unit consisting of drums and housing normally of stainless steel. The magnetic drum separators are available both in single or double drum configuration. 12.

Figure 9.2 shows a permanent magnetic drum separator which consists mainly of a permanent magnet system a rotating drum a separating chute a feed tank and a flushing pipe.For magnetite separation the magnetic field intensity on the surface of the drum is between 0.1 and 0.4 T. However for other appliions the intensity may reach as high as 0.8 T.

## Why can't the poles of a magnet be separated
You can think of the answer mathematically. Gauss's law of magnetism tells us that divergence of magnetic field is zero. This means the volume density of the outward flux of the magnetic field from an infinitesimal volume around a given point is e

## Optimizing the performance of wet drum J magnetic separators
magnetic separators by M. Dworzanowski Synopsis The difference in the magnetic properties of minerals is the basis for magnetic separation. All minerals can be generally classified as ferromagnetic (strongly magnetic) paramagnetic (weakly magnetic) or diamagnetic (non-magnetic). Magnetic separation can be conducted dry or wet.

## >>4.18 Separation 
Magnetic separation is specifically used on heavy metals radionuclides and magnetic radioactive particles such as uranium and plutonium compounds. Physical separation often precedes chemical extraction treatment based on the assumption that most of the contamination is tied to the finer soil fraction which alone may need to be treated.

## Magnetic particle separation a short review 
Commercial magnetic particle separation. One of the earliest works in magnetic capturing using bulk magnets was reported by Miltenyi in [1]. In this work a Magnetic Cell Sorter (MACS) from Miltenyi Biotec is used to separate cells labeled with magnetic particles from non-labeled cells. Three basic steps can be observed: the objects of interest

## Electromagnetic separation 
Only electromagnetic separation is characterized by an a value of 10–1000 per separation cycle. Selection of the method of isotope separation depends on such considerations as the properties of the substance to be separated the required degree of separation the desired isotope quantity and the cost of the process (at high volumes of isotope production).

2. Magnetic separation Cells are separated in a MACS Column placed in a MACS Separator. The flow-through fraction can be collected as the negative fraction depleted of the labeled cells. 3. Elution of labeled cells The column is removed from the separator. The retained cells are eluted as the enriched positively selected cell fraction.

## Difference Between Magnetite and Hematite 
 · Hematite has unpaired electrons that cause its magnetic properties. It is paramagnetic because it has only ferric ion (Fe 3+).The electron configuration of Fe 3+ is 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 2 3p 6 3d 5 where 5 unpaired electrons are present. Therefore hematite can be separated from a mixture using high-intensity magnetic separation methods which use magnetic fields with intensity ranging from
