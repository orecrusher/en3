## beneficiation applies to mineral processing
What Is Beneficiation In Mineral Processing? Therefore beneficiation is an intermediate stage between the natural state of the ore and the pure commercial product However there are three forms of mineral beneficiation Which are: Converting the ore into concentrate such as copper from 05% to 30% lead from 25% to 50% tungsten from 0102% to 4565% molybdenum from 01007% to 46

## Manganese ore beneficiation and processing technology 
Manganese ore processing has many processes such as magnetic separation flotation gravity separation and so on. In actual production Fodamon adopt the simple and easy-to-concentrate manganese ore mostly adopts magnetic separation process while the difficult-to-concentrate manganese ore often needs a combination of various mineral processing processes and a combined mineral processing process.
