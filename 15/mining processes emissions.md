For emissions of other pollutants a mass balance approach is no longer used. It is likely that emissions will arise from the combustion of the coke oven gas produced by some SSF retorts but this combustion is not identified in the energy statistics. Process emissions from SSF plant are estimated on the basis of total production of SSF.
