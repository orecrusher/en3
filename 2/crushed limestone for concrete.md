 · Crushed vs Round aggregate in concrete. ACI 318-05 and -08 does not appear to reward the designer for specifying crushed aggregate over rounded (usually "river rock") in structural concrete. Chapter 4 refers to ASTM C33 and leaves it at that. Certainly crushed rock has better interlock and must have better shear friction for roughened surfaces.

Limestone is frequently found in shades of gray from nearly white to almost as dark as slate. But limestone can also include pale shades of yellows and browns. These softer tones make it a perfect understated neutral component in landscaping or property design. When it's not solid limestone you'll often find it listed as "crushed" limestone.

 · Crushed stone is a material that is typically used as a base or underlayment upon which the stuff that actually shows -- for example the concrete of a patio -- will rest. Guessing is rarely a good solution to such dilemmas when undertaking a big project so let's look at a (relatively) simple way to figure out the correct amount. The word "relatively" is used because a formula is involved.

 · To make Portland cement—the most common type of cement—powdered limestone is heated in a rotary kiln. As a source of calcium it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker which is then ground with a source of sulfate like gypsum.
