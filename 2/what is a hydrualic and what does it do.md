## What is hydraulic fracturing? 
Hydraulic fracturing informally referred to as "fracking" is an oil and gas well development process that typically involves injecting water sand and chemicals under high pressure into a bedrock formation via the well. This process is intended to create new fractures in the rock as well as increase the size extent and connectivity of existing fractures.

What Does a Hydraulic Engineer Do? (with pictures) May 28 2020 · A hydraulic engineer specializes in the effects of water in one or many disciplines. The nature of water in regard to flow runoff flooding and how it is affected by weather can be used from an engineering perspective to help in the design of civil engineering projects.

## How hydraulics works 
 · The science behind hydraulics is called Pascal's principle. Essentially because the liquid in the pipe is incompressible the pressure must stay constant all the way through it even when you're pushing it hard at one end or the other. Now pressure is defined as the force acting per unit of area.

## The Basic Idea 
The neat thing about hydraulic systems is that it is very easy to add force multipliion (or division) to the system. If you have read How a Block and Tackle Works or How Gears Work then you know that trading force for distance is very common in mechanical systems. In a hydraulic system all you do is change the size of one piston and cylinder relative to the other.

The Log Splitter Hydraulic Circuit. Most log splitters use a hydraulic cylinder ( like these) to push a cut piece of log into a sharpened wedge which splits it. The cylinder is driven by hydraulic oil under pressure produced by a hydraulic pump. An engine or electric motor drives the pump shaft and supplies the power for the system.

## How Do Office Chair Hydraulics Work? 
 · Hydraulics uses incompressible liquid metal (such as oil) to enable machinery movement and pneumatics use an easily compressible gas such as air (or a pure gas) to enable the same functionality. Hydraulic systems can move heavy loads however pneumatic technology is cleaner used for lighter loads (such as office chairs) and is both safer and easier to store.
