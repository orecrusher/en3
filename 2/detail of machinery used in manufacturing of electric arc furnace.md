 · In the case of three-phase arc furnaces two types of asymmetry can be distinguished: constructional and operational. The structural asymmetry is related to the construction of high-current circuits supplying the arc furnace. The knowledge of the parameters of the high-current circuit allows to determine the operating characteristics of the arc device.

 · Unlike integrated steel mills which make new steel from iron ore in a blast furnace mini mills melt and refine scrap steel using electric arc furnace (EAF) technology. According to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report while mini mills accounted for 10 percent of U.S. steel production in 1970 by 2006 over half of the national steel output was produced in mini mills.

## Changes in steel production reduce energy intensity 
 · Secondary production of steel typically uses an electric arc furnace with scrap providing the main input. In an electric arc furnace scrap is melted using electricity. Natural gas can also supplement the melting process. Overall energy intensity of an electric arc furnace is significantly lower than the energy intensity of a basic oxygen furnace.

## Steel manufacture 
Modern electric arc furnaces can make up to 150 tonnes of steel in a single melt. The electric arc furnace consists of a circular bath with a movable roof through which three graphite electrodes can be raised or lowered. At the start of the process the electrodes are withdrawn and the roof swung clear.

 · Electric arc furnaces: In the electric arc furnace (EAF) method high-current electric arcs from electrodes melt large quantities of steel scraps into liquid. While the steel scrap metal is melting the technicians add in other ferroalloys until the metal liquid reaches its desired ratio of steel to other alloys such as chromium and nickel which form stainless steel.
