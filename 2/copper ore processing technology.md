## Ore enrichment 
A mechanical process of copper ore enrichment is essential for effective smelting. The concentration level obtained at the enrichment stage makes the copper material fit for further processing at the smelter. This processing is required due to the fact that the copper ore deposits mined by KGHM in Poland contain on average only 1.52% of copper. The technology used by the KGHM Concetration

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores 
Copper processing is a complied process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called hodes which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore copper oxide and copper sulfide undergo two different processes hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy respectively due to the different

## Copper Smelting Process 
 · Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper being further processed in a converter furnace. Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity. Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being
