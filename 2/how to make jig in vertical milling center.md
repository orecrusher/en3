Boring mills and milling machines. The dimensions between the piece and the tool bit can be changed about two axes to cut both vertically and horizontally into the internal surface. The cutting tool is usually single point made of M2 and M3 high-speed steel or P10 and P01 carbide. A tapered hole can also be made by swiveling the head.
