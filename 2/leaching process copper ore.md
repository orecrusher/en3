## Agglomeration Drums in the Heap Leaching Process
Heap leaching a process by which metals such as gold and copper are recovered from ore has long been a method of choice in ore beneficiation with appliions growing all the time.. While this process has proven to be efficient often chosen for its cost-effectiveness the efficiency of the heap leaching process can be further improved through the addition of an agglomeration drum.

 · Heap leaching relies on a leaching agent moving through a bed of heaped ore to extract the metallic components: Crushed ore is stacked on a leaching pad and irrigated with the leaching agent. The leaching agent chemically reacts with the metal in the ore to dissolve the copper into the solution as it percolates through the heap.
