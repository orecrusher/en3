## Pipe equivalent length (pneumatic conveying)
1. Definition - What does equivalent length of pipe mean. Several methods to calculate the pressure drop expected in a pneumatic conveying pipe and design it is using the notion of equivalent pipe length. This notion is actually quite convenient to simplify the calculation of pressure drop.

## Pneumatic Conveying Systems 
A pneumatic system can convey a product at any place a pipe line can run. Pneumatic conveying can be used for particles ranging from fine powders to pellets and bulk densities of 16 to 3200 kg/m3 (1 to 200 lb/ft3). As a general rule pneumatic conveying will work for particles up to 2 inches in diameter typical density. By "typical
