 · The open pit method involves using heavy machinery to mine deposits relatively near the earth's surface. In underground mining deep shafts are dug into the ground to extract ore. Once ores are extracted they are crushed ground and separated through a process called "flotation" to achieve mineral concentrations that are 30-40 times higher than naturally occurs.

No doubt there was a time when prospectors acquired the burnished yellow ore by pulling out rusty sifting pans but that's no longer the case. No heavy duty mining equipment is now used to extract massive loads of gold. That mechanized process begins on the day diggers arrive at the open-face mine.
