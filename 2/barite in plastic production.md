## Barite Market Size 
The consumption of barite in the U.S. spiked sharply by more than 80% owing to a significant increase in rig counts particularly for offshore drilling in most leading oil- and gas-producing states. In terms of volume roughly 90% of the barite sold in the U.S. was for oil gas drilling markets while the remaining 10% was for other industrial end uses such as chemicals and filler manufacturing.

 · Considering that barite is an ionic-covalent solid its microstructural refinement occurs via repeated brittle fractures not by severe plastic deformation. According to Galán et al. (2009) a minimum crystal size is reached when the compressive stress on individual particles is below their fracture strength (which varies inversely with the particle sizes).
