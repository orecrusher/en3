Zinc prices went up due mainly to a lack of mine supply (partially from curtailments and closures during 2015–16) and strong growth in galvanized steel demand. [19] Due to limited U.S. refinery capacity the vast majority of zinc in ore and concentrates produced domestically was exported.

## Zinc Concentrate 
Sphalerite (zinc sulfide) is the primary ore mineral from which most of the world's zinc is produced but a number of other minerals that do not contain sulfide contain zinc as a major component. Much of the early zinc production was from nonsulfide deposits; however as these resources were exhausted production shifted to sulfide deposits.

Zinc oxide is prepared commercially by two methods: the American (or direct) process which uses zinc ore and concentrate and the French (or indirect) process which uses zinc metal. Some 54% of US zinc oxide production is from zinc ore and concentrate (American process) 33% from slab zinc (French process) and 13% from secondary material.

## Uses of Zinc 
 · Sphalerite: The Primary Ore. Sphalerite (zinc sulfide) is the primary ore mineral from which most of the world's zinc is produced but a number of other minerals that do not contain sulfide contain zinc as a major component. Much of the early zinc production was from nonsulfide deposits; however as these resources were exhausted production shifted to sulfide deposits.

It is the process of extraction of zinc from its ores and the preparation of zinc metal for use in various products. The most commonly available ore in the extraction of Zinc is Zinc Blende also known as Zinc Sulphide (ZnS) and other ores include Calamine Zincite etc. Zinc Blende does not contain a very high percentage of zinc so it needs to be concentrated.
