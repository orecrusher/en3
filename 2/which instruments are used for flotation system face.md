A personal flotation device—also known as a PFD—gives you more buoyancy to help you stay afloat in water. A PFD is an essential piece of gear for every kayaker canoer and stand up paddle boarder. (Note that a life jacket or life vest denotes a certain type of PFD though many people use the terms interchangeably.)

## Float solar panels on reservoirs behind dams for more energy
 · Floating solar farms on existing hydropower reservoirs could cut solar costs and meet 40 percent of the world's energy needs they found. In general putting solar panels on water bodies avoids land-use conflicts. It also boosts PV efficiency due to the temperature-regulating effect of water and minimal shading while the water body benefits

F. Schenkelberg in Reliability Characterisation of Electrical and Electronic Systems 2015 11.5.1 Time compression. A typical solar tracking system adjusts the face of the solar panel or reflective surfaces to align with the sun as it moves across the sky. The system moves though one rotation per day. It is this relatively slow motion that enables the time-compression approach for ALT.

## A Reliability and Validity of an Instrument to Evaluate 
An instrument is valid when it is measuring what is supposed to measure [20]. Or in other words when an instrument accurately measures any prescribed variable it is considered a valid instrument for that particular variable. There are four types of validity; face validity criterion validity content validity or construct validity [20][21].

 · Why Float Matters. It might seem that float is just a technical number used in network diagrams but it is actually a very powerful tool that can help teams learn more about their work and help improve the productivity of projects.. It Keeps Projects on Track. To start monitoring a project's total float (TF) is crucial to ensuring that the overall project is going to be delivered on time.
