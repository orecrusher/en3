Project History. Mining has occurred throughout the Flinders Ranges dating from the late 1800's principally for copper ore by means of shallow underground workings. The Lorna Doone lease was briefly mined as very small open cut operations by gougers Paltridge and Sickerdick in the late 1960's.

Mining and Metallurgy Factors or Assumptions Mining of the sulphide deposit has historically been by long hole open stoping. The mined ore was processed on site to produce copper concentrate. This has been successful over the life of the project (>10yrs) and therefore metallurgically the deposit is amenable to the method adopted.

The Project considers open pit mining of 21.7 million tonnes of ore from the La Pava and Quema-Quemita pits and will be developed in multiple phases. Ore will be crushed to 80% passing 105 mm in a single stage jaw crusher. Lime will be added to the crushed ore for pH control before being conveyor stacked and leached with a dilute cyanide solution.

## The Thacker Pass Mine is Indeed Benign Compared to Most 
 · Gold and copper mines do not have this opportunity since they are following an ore body that is much less uniform than the lithium ore body at Thacker Pass. While the trenches will not be completely refilled at Thacker Pass the plan is to produce a reclaimed area that will have similar vegetation as presently exists and will return the land to wildlife habitat.
