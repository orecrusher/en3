The blast or shaft furnace is well-suited for smelting high-grade lumpy copper ore. If only fine concentrates are available they must first be agglomerated by briquetting pelletizing or sintering. Because of this additional step and its overall low efficiency the blast furnace lost its importance for primary copper production and is currently used in only a few places for example Glogow in Poland.
