Beneficiation is followed by processing activities such as smelting and refining. The beneficiation process begins with milling which is followed by flotation for further beneficiation. At the first stage extracted ores undergo the milling operation to produce uniformly sized particles for crushing grinding wet or dry concentration.

Employing wet magnetic separation early in a process can greatly benefit an operation if a low-grade final tailing or a clean marketable product can be produced since it alleviates both drying and dry storage costs.

Iron ore sample found is a part of banded iron ore formation. Hematite and goethite are major constituents of iron ore samples. Hematite in the ore sample occurs as specularite with inter granular micro-pore spaces. Goethite is profuse and occurs as colloform product in cavities in addition with the weaker bedding planes.
