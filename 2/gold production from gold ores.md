## Gold Production From Gold Ores 
Gold production declined and many gold mines closed during World War I () due to a shortage of manpower decreasing ore reserves and increasing costs. During the depression in the early 1930s gold mines were brought back to life and prospectors thoroughly searched the known and little-known gold-producing areas.
