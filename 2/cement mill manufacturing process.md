Energy consumption and output. Cement mills are normally driven by electric motors. Modern installations draw power of 2-10 MW. The power (in kW) required to turn a ball mill is approximated by: P = 0.285 d (1.073-j) m n where d is the internal diameter in metres j is the fraction of the mill volume occupied by media m is the total mass of media in the mill in tonnes and n is the mill

 · Cement - Cement - Extraction and processing: Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones slates and some shales with the aid of blasting when necessary. Some deposits are mined by underground methods. Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.

Manufacturing the cement kiln Understanding Cement. From both a process and chemical viewpoint it is beneficial to minimise clinker temperature as it enters the cement mill. The milling process generates heat and excessive mill temperatures are undesirable. It is clearly helpful therefore if the clinker is cool as it enters the mill.
