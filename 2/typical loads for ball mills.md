## Optimizing your SAG mill operation 
 · The mill discharge from these mills consists of slurry which goes to the ball mills for further grinding and coarse pebbles/rocks which are crushed and sent back to the mill. To maximize the capacity of these circuits the general practice is to use grates with pebble ports (reaching 100 mm) instead of normal grate openings to increase the pebble removal.
