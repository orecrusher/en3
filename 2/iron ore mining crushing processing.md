 · Because the ore to be ground passes through the grinding machine only once the product size is relatively coarse. This type of process is commonly used in the first stage of the single-stage rod milling process or the first stage of the two-stage grinding process with rod mills. The ore can be ground from 20-25 mm to about 3 mm at a time.

Malcolm Tatum Raw ore deposits have to be crushed and processed. The processing of iron ore is a task that involves taking the raw ore and preparing it for use in the creation of a number of different iron products. There are actually several different processes that may be used to aid in this conversion of the raw ore into useful iron components.
