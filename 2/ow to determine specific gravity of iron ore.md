 · SG = ρ / ρW. Where SG is specific gravity. (unitless) ρ is the density of your substance (kg/m^3) ρW is the density of water (kg/m^2) A few things need to be kept in mind in order to accurately calculate specific gravity. First the units of density need to be equal for both the substance and water or the result will not be accurate.

Column 6 gives the nominal (average) specific gravity of each density range for example material in the density range 1.30–1.40 is assumed to have a specific gravity lying midway between these densities that is 1.35. Since the −1.30 specific gravity fraction and the +2.00 specific gravity fraction have no bound no nominal density is given.

## Density Specific Gravity 
Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass (weight) of a rock to the mass of the same volume of water. Water has a density of 1.0 g/cm 3 so the numeric value of specific gravity for a rock is the same as that for density. Because specific gravity is a ratio it has no unit. Specific gravity

Specific gravity can be measured in a number of value ways. A pycnometer is simply a bottle which can be precisely filled to a specific but not necessarily accurately known volume. Placed upon a balance of some sort it will exert a force where using the mass of the bottle filled with the product being tested and the mass of the bottle full of water the specific gravity can be calculated.
