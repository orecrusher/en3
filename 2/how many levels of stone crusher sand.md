With a more properly graded 3/4" washed stone (such as a good filter stone ranging between the 3/8" and 1" diameter) you will have a loose drop of more like 75% but you will also actually be able to get closer to 100% without talking about your subgrade. If the subgrade is sandy it will not invade such a well graded gravel as much.

 · Crushed stone: If you hear the generic "crushed stone" term it usually refers to stone that has a mixture of stone dust in it. This type of stone is best used for a base when heavy compaction is needed. As a result it is typically used for the base of concrete and paving projects foundations of structures and driveway bases.
