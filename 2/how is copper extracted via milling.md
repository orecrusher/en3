## The Extraction of Copper 
 · Chalcopyrite (also known as copper pyrites) and similar sulfide ores are the commonest ores of copper. The ores typically contain low percentages of copper and have to be concentrated before refining (e.g. via froth flotation).

## Copper extraction 
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source local environmental regulations and other factors.. As in all mining operations the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## copper extraction and purifiion 
Purifiion of copper. When copper is made from sulphide ores by the first method above it is impure. The blister copper is first treated to remove any remaining sulphur (trapped as bubbles of sulphur dioxide in the copper - hence "blister copper") and then cast into anodes for refining using electrolysis. Electrolytic refining
