 · The feed samples of X Y and Z iron ores were ground in the BBM (ball mill refers to a BBM of size 300 mm × 300 mm with smooth liners) to identify the PSD BWI and RT of each ore. Grinding experiments were conducted according to Bond's standard test procedure [].For each iron ore sample the RT taken to produce 250% circulating load in the BBM was measured by a new method.
