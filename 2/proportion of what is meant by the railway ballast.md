## BALLAST TUBES 
Ballast tubes are glass or metal-enveloped plug-in tubes that contain a ballast resistor. the voltage drop will be directly proportional to the current flowing through it. This non-standardization meant that many different versions were manufactured which made it difficult for the radio service man to service receivers with these units.

 · I perfer to wet the ballast with water/ alcohol and apply the diluted white glue (1:1 or 2:1) Someone did mention about using the glue straight for the ballast shoulders. This is what I do. If you paint on the glue w/ foam brush and add ballast it helps to act as a dam for remainging ballast as not to have it fall off the shoulders.

## Track circuits explained 
 · What are track circuits? How do they keep the railway safe? And why do they sometimes delay journeys? A track circuit forms part of the broader signalling system which comprises many parts to enable trains to move safely around the network.. A track circuit itself is an electrical system that detects the absence of a train on a section of track.

## TAMPING MACHINE FEATURES COMPONENTS AND FUNCTIONS
 · Ballast tamping is the process to restore the geometry and re-arrange the ballast under the sleeper to keep the track in position and provide it with a homogenous ballast bed. The track geometry should be measured regularly or at least the track should be tamped at regular intervals to ensure that trains are able to travel safely at the normal speed of the line.

## Dynamic testing of railway ballast using the slake 
There are no current durability tests in the Railway Ballast Standards for new ballast (Railtrack Line Specifiion 1998) or for ballast returned from a ballast cleaner (Railtrack Line Specifiion 1996). This is considered to be lacking as the trains impose a dynamic loading rather than a point load.

 · In the June of 1932 the Southern railway Magazine reported that some 10000 tone of ballast was taken from Meldon Quarry. It also stated how most of the work was carried out during the night and that four times a week a train leaves the quarry consisting of ten special trucks that each holds forty tons of ballast.
