Milling was then performed in 80% ethanol for 30–120 minutes using a high-energy ball mill. The mechanical treatment resulted in a reduction of the fibre length and diameter probably due to degradation of the cellulose amorphous regions. Fibrillation was helped by the wet environment which facilitated the intra-fibre swelling.

 · A convenient expression for the ratio is the Q value which is equal to the perce nt wall reduction divided by the percent ID reduction. A Q value of 2 or higher tends to smooth the ID surface. When the schedule does not lend itself to a series of high-Q-value draws it is better to use a high-Q-value rod draw followed by a hard sink rather than a series of low-Q-value drawing operations.
