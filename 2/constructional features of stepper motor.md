A stepper motor also known as step motor or stepping motor is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. The motor's position can be commanded to move and hold at one of these steps without any position sensor for feedback (an open-loop controller) as long as the motor is correctly sized to the appliion in respect to torque and speed.

The stepper motor works like an electrical machine and converts electrical energy into mechanical energy which it releases via a shaft. With the help of a highly realistic 3D animation we describe among other things the design features of a stepper motor such as the toothed rotor whose electromagnets are slightly offset from each other.
