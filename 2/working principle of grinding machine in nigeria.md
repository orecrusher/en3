 · Grinding is a metal cutting process in which the material is removed from the workpiece by the abrasive action of rotating cutting tool known as a grinding wheel which rotates at a high speed (v= 10-80 m/s) while the work is fed past the wheel at a rate of 0.2 m/s to 0.6 m/s. It has some similarity with up milling operation except that the cutting points are irregularly shaped and randomly
