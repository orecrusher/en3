## 12.3 Law of conservation of energy 
The sand is warmer but we can not actually use that energy for anything because the temperature increase was so small. No energy has been created or destroyed just transferred from the Sun to the plant to the animal. Let's revise the energy transfers within some systems by studying and drawing flow diagrams. Flow diagrams for energy transfers.

In plants adhesion forces water up the columns of cells in the xylem and through fine tubes in the cell wall. Environmental conditions like heat wind and dry air can increase the rate of transpiration from a plant's leaves causing water to move more quickly through the xylem. Sometimes the pull from the leaves is stronger than the weak

## How does sand form? 
Sand comes from many loions sources and environments. Sand forms when rocks break down from weathering and eroding over thousands and even millions of years. Rocks take time to decompose especially quartz (silica) and feldspar.
