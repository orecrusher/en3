## Roller versus hammer: Corn particle size impacts 
 · Roller mills are the most common mill used in the U.S. Corn Belt. They are more energy efficient and generally result in a more uniform particle size than hammer mills. However hammer mills are still in use and preferred when the feed will be pelleted or a need for greater flexibility in particle size.

## Hammermills versus roller mills 
Roller mills simply "roll" or "crush" product between two revolving cylinders. This latter process has the distinct advantage of requiring considerably less power although it is not possible to achieve the fineness of final grind through a roller mill that can be achieved through a hammermill.

## COMPARISON OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY BETWEEN A ROLLER MILL 
AIt is generally believed that roller mills utilize energy more efficiently than hammer mills (Silver 1931; Puckett and Daum 1968; Appel 1987). To verify this a completely randomized factorial experimental design (CRD) with two repliions was constructed: a total of 72 grinding tests was conducted to compare the energy efficiency between a roller mill and a hammer mill.
