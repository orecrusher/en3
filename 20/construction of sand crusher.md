## CONCRETE MIX DESIGN USING CRUSHED SAND 
From technical point of view the rich mixes may lead to high shrinkage and cracking in the structural concrete and to evolution of high heat of hydration in mass concrete which may cause cracking. In this study we have used grit and crushed sand for the design mix and found the characteristic compressive strength at 37 and 28 days respectively.
