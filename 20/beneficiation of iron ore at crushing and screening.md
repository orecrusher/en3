Screening is an important step for dry beneficiation of iron ore. Crushing and screening is typically the first step of iron ore beneficiation processes. In most ores including iron ore valuable minerals are usually intergrown with gangue minerals so the minerals need to be separated in order to be liberated.

## Beneficiation 
Beneficiation is followed by processing activities such as smelting and refining. The beneficiation process begins with milling which is followed by flotation for further beneficiation. At the first stage extracted ores undergo the milling operation to produce uniformly sized particles for crushing grinding wet or dry concentration.

-50 mm crushed ore produced a concentrate assaying 60.6 Fe with a further recovery of 7.2% Fe in it. In another series of tests the R.O.M ore was 110 screened on 63 mm screen. The +63 mrrr protion was separately crushed to -63 mm and wet screened on 9 mm screen. The +9 mm lumps analysed 62.5% Fe with 36.9% Fe distri-bution in it.

## What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures)
Water molecules are removed as part of iron ore beneficiation. One of the approaches to iron ore beneficiation first involves a basic screening or filtering of the ore and then crushing it using equipment like a jaw crusher to break up the rock from its natural state down to individual block or rock sizes with dimensions of length or height no greater than 3.3 feet (1 meter).

## Iron ore and its beneficiation: 
 · Iron ore and its beneficiation: Most useful metal in the world Iron is extracted from iron ore. It is the rock from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. Iron ore is a mineral substance which when heated in the presence of a reductant will yield metallic iron (Fe). The iron ore usually very rich in iron oxides (Fe3O4 and Fe2O3).
