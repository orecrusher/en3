## Cement – Analysis 
Clinker is the main ingredient in cement and the amount used is directly proportional to the CO 2 emissions generated in cement manufacturing due to both the combustion of fuels and the decomposition of limestone in the clinker production process.. From 2014 to 2018 the clinker-to-cement ratio increased at an average of 1.6% per year reaching an estimated 0.70 in 2018; this rise

 · Though "cement" and "concrete" are often used interchangeably concrete is actually the final product made from cement. The primary component of cement is limestone. To produce cement limestone and other clay-like materials are heated in a kiln at 1400°C and then ground to form a lumpy solid substance called clinker; clinker is then combined with gypsum to form cement.
