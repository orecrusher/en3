 · For example an ore containing the mineral chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) derives its value from the contained copper. Chalcopyrite does not in and of itself have any direct use as a mineral. Once chalcopyrite is concentrated (separated from the gangue) it requires further trewatment to extract copper via chemical (hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurcial) methods.

## Copper extraction 
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source local environmental regulations and other factors.. As in all mining operations the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

During beneficiation of clay-containing copper-gold ores the use of small quantities of Na 2 S (at natural pH) improves both copper and gold metallurgy considerably. In the presence of soluble ions (e.g. Fe Cu) additions of small quantities of organic acid (e.g. oxalic tartaric) improve gold recovery in the copper concentrate.

## Handbook of Flotation Reagents: Chemistry Theory and 
Publisher Summary. This chapter discusses beneficiation processes for various tin ores. There are three main methods used for beneficiation of tin ores: physical concentration including gravity concentration magnetic separation and electrostatic separation flotation and a combination of gravity preconcentration and flotation.

Figure 2: Overview of a typical beneficiation process at a concentrator Sulfidic copper ores are too dilute for direct smelting. Smelting these materials would require too much energy and very large furnace capacities. The copper ore coming from the mine (0.5 – 1 % Cu) must be concentrated by beneficiation.

Beneficiation can begin within the mine itself. Most mines will have a crusher within the mine itself where separation of ore and gangue minerals occurs and as a side effect becomes easier to transport. After the crusher the ore will go through a grinder or a mill to get the ore into fine particles.
