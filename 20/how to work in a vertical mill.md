## Historically: How to Site a Mill 
The vertical mill wheel made it necessary to build a gear system to change the horizontal rotation of the main shaft into a vertical motion that could be used inside the mill to power the millstones. The smallest and the largest vertical mills have a gear system incorporating wooden (squirrel cage) pinion gears (called " TRUNDLES ") that were mounted at the bottom of the shafts that turned

## How It Works – Getting Bored 
"You might only be working on three feet by three feet of it but you could put a 10' tall part on the table whereas with a vertical machine you could only put maybe a three foot part on the table." Despite these differences vertical and horizontal mills generally see equal amounts of use.
