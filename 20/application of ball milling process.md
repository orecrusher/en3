Ball milling is a way to exfoliate graphite using lateral force as opposed to the Scotch Tape or soniion that mainly use normal force. Ball mills like the three roll machine are a common occurrence in industry for the production of fine particles. During the ball milling process there are two factors that contribute to the exfoliation.
