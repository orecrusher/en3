## Aluminium Production Process 
The Bayer process dissolves the aluminium component of bauxite ore in sodium hydroxide (caustic soda); removes impurities from the solution; and precipitates alumina tri hydrate which is then calcined to aluminium oxide. A Bayer Process plant is principally a device for heating and cooling a large re circulating stream of caustic soda solution.

Aluminum processing - Aluminum processing - Ores: Aluminum is the third most abundant element on Earth's surface. Only oxygen and silicon are more common. Earth's crust to a depth of 16 km (10 miles) contains 8 percent aluminum. Aluminum has a strong tendency to combine with other common elements and so rarely occurs in nature in the metallic form.

## Aluminium production process
This process produces a thick paste that is collected in special containers and heated with steam to remove most of the silicon present in bauxites. The ore is loaded into autoclaves and treated with lime–caustic soda. Aluminium oxide appears in the resulting slurry while all the admixtures settle to the bottom as red mud.

## How aluminium is produced
The aluminium production process can be broken down into three stages; first bauxites which contain aluminium are extracted from the ground. Second bauxites are processed into alumina or aluminium oxide and finally in stage three pure aluminium is produced using electrolytic reduction a process in which aluminium oxide is broken down into its components using electric current.

## How aluminum is made 
The Bayer process for refining aluminum ore developed in 1888 by an Austrian chemist also contributed significantly to the economical mass production of aluminum. In 1884 125 lb (60 kg) of aluminum was produced in the United States and it sold for about the same unit price as silver.
