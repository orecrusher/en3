PCB printing begins after designers output the PCB schematic files and manufacturers conduct a DFM check. Manufacturers use a special printer called a plotter which makes photo films of the PCBs to print circuit boards. Manufacturers will use the films to image the PCBs. Although it's a laser printer it isn't a standard laser jet printer.

## All About PCB Prepreg 
The Prepreg and core are two different parts of the PCB. Core is the copper clad laminate (CCL) which is a dielectric substrate with copper either side or both sides. The dielectric substrate can be FR4 Polyimide Polyester PTFE CEM-1 CEM-3 and insulated metal. Except for meal insulated (IMS i.e. aluminum based and copper based) cores

## Printed Circuit Boards Assembly (PCBA) Process 
Most people recognize printed circuit boards when they see them. These are the small green chips covered in lines and copper parts you'll find at the heart of gutted electronic devices. Made with fiberglass copper lines and other metal parts these boards are held together with epoxy and insulated with a solder mask.

## Printed Circuit Board Design Diagram and Assembly 
 · Printed Circuit Board Design or Printed Circuit Board (PCB) or Printed Wiring Board (PWB) is a board made out of insulating and highly heat-resistant insulating material such as fiberglass.These boards are also called substrates. A substrate or board may have only one single layer (single-layer circuit board) or more than one layer (multilayer circuit board).

## PCB FR4: the guide to FR
A standard FR-4 PCB will have a layer of FR-4 sandwiched between two thin layers of laminated copper. FR-4 uses bromine a so-called halogen chemical element that is fire resistant. It replaced G-10 another composite that was less resistant in most of its appliions. FR4 has the advantage of having a good resistance-weight ratio.
