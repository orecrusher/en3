 · Much more seriously fossil-fueled CHP plants reinforce our dependency on the very fuels we should be trying to eliminate (though it is possible to run them on greener fuels such as biomass). Some critics argue that CHP is overhyped and less efficient than alternative technologies such as ground-source heat pumps which deployed at scale could be a far better way to tackle climate change.

## Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Systems 
A CHP power plant is a decentralized energy-efficient method of heat and electricity production. CHP plants can be loed in an individual building or facility or they can produce energy for a district or a utility. In CHP a fuel is used to drive the prime mover to generate electricity and produce heat.

## bHow much more efficient is CHP? 
CHP is far more efficient (wastes much less energy) than conventional power plants. A conventional plant is at best about 60 percent efficient (for every 100 tons of coal or other fuel it burns 40 tons is completely wasted); a CHP plant can be 90 percent efficient or even more. That gives a huge saving in fuel and operating costs and a major environmental benefit.

## What it costs: CHP (combined heat and power systems 
 · To be cost effective CHP systems need to run for 4000–5000 hours a year. CHP systems can sell excess electricity to the grid although connection costs may be high and the income low. Alternative procurement arrangements may offer better value to organisations that wish to save energy without CHP's high capital outlay.
