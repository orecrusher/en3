 · The per cent of iron in the ore as mined must be not less than 50% if it is to be used without being first improved (beneficiated) by cobbing washing calcining or magnetic concentration. Leaner ore is found in very large quantities; and in a favorable situation it may be workable by some concentrating process.

Iron ore is a natural material that is mined all around the world. Iron ore fines are created as a result of mining crushing and processing the larger pieces of ore. Iron ore fines are less desirable (and of lower value) as they need to be sintered before they can be utilised otherwise it will effectively smother the air flow in the blast furnace.
