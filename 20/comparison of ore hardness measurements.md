## Steel hardness test methods and hardness conversion 
The hardness of steel is important to many processes. Steel hardness describes the properties of steel that enable it to resist plastic deformation indentation penetration and scratching. In engineering steel hardness is important because the inherent resistance of the surface to withstand friction or erosion by oil steam and water typically increases with the relative hardness of steel.

## 5 Ways to Measure the Hardness of Materials
 · Brinell Hardness Test. The Brinell hardness test entails measuring the diameter of indentation caused by a constant concentrated force applied by a steel or carbide spherical indenter on a test specimen. The steel ball indenter is first placed in contact with the material before a constant force is applied and maintained for a 10 to 15 second duration known as the dwell time.

## Hardness 
Hardness is a measure of the resistance to localized plastic deformation induced by either mechanical indentation or abrasion.In general different materials differ in their hardness; for example hard metals such as titanium and beryllium are harder than soft metals such as sodium and metallic tin or wood and common plastics.Macroscopic hardness is generally characterized by strong

## Measurement of hardness: Explanation
Hardness is the property of a material that enables it to resist plastic deformation usually by penetration. There are elastic and dynamic processes to measure hardness. The usual method to achieve a hardness value is to measure the depth or area of an indentation left by an indenter of a specific shape with a specific force applied for a specific time.

A reading of 0 Shore describes the maximum possible indentation of the rod into the specimen and 100 Shore indies almost no indentation al all or a very high resistance to indentation.

The Brinell hardness number (HB) is the load divided by the surface area of the indentation. The diameter of the impression is measured with a microscope with a superimposed scale. The Brinell hardness number is computed from the equation: There are a variety of test methods in common use (e.g. Brinell Knoop Vickers and Rockwell).

Hardness describes the resistance that a material exhibits to permanent indentation or marking by scratches. Hardness is not a material property rather a value ascribed to a material as a result of empirical testing. There are six main hardness tests that can be carried out: Vickers Rockwell Brinell Mohs Shore and Knoop.

The Mohs scale is a system used to rank materials on their hardness which is graded using numbers from 1 to 10. It can be used to compare gemstones metals and other materials and evaluate their relative durability. Where a metal stands on the Mohs scale indies which other metals can scratch it. For example gold's hardness rating is 2.5

## Hardness (measurement conversion) 
A standard ball is used for the Brinell hardness test on materials with a BHN value of less than 450. This test which was devised by the Swedish engineer Dr Johan August Brinell is less accurate than the Vickers method but benefits from not actually requiring any special equipment so long as you can accurately measure the applied load making it ideal for improvisation.
