## Dephosphorization Treatment of High Phosphorus Iron Ore by 
IntroductionThe behavior of phosphorus in the solid state carbothermic reduction process and the dephosphorization treatment of high phosphorus iron ore by pre-reduction mechanical crushing and screening methods were discussed in the previous work. 12) The reduced iron ore phases were characterized according to their behavior under uni-axial mechanical loading.

 · BENEFICIATION DEPHOSPHORIZATION AND DESULPHURIZATION OF AGBAJA IRON ORE. Iron ores are used in blast furnace for the production of pig iron; Agbaja Iron ore has an estimated reserve of over I billion metric tonnes. Unfortunately this large reserve cannot be utilized for the production of pig iron due to its high sulphur and phosphorus contents.

 · Urban ores can be classified into two types—those made up of items that were in the possession of consumers such as end‐of‐life home appliances and those that were not such as manufacturing wastes. The dephosphorization slag generated at some steelmaking plants is an example of a manufacturing waste.

phosphorus from these ores has become essential in order to maintain the persistent quality of steel [1]. Increased levels of phosphorus in steel can lead to cold shortness causing brittleness and poor toughness [23]. The process of phosphorus removal from iron ores is known as dephosphorization.

## Effect of additives on iron recovery and dephosphorization 
 · The effect of CaCO 3 Na 2 CO 3 and CaF 2 on the reduction roasting-magnetic separation of high-phosphorus iron ore containing phosphorus as Fe 3 PO 7 and apatite was investigated. The result shows that Na 2 CO 3 had the best effect on iron recovery and dephosphorization followed by CaCO3 while CaF2 had almost no influence.
