 · Shortage of raw materials could limit DRI growth. Unlike in the production of blast-furnace pig iron iron ore remains solid throughout the DRI-production process which makes it difficult to remove impurities (Exhibit 2). As a result the quality of the DRI is closely related to the quality of iron ore inputs.

Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale. The float ore area is dug up manually with picks crow bars and spades and then the material is manually screened and then stacked up. The waste is thrown back into the pits.

## Sublevel caving 
Ore is mined from sublevels spaced at regular intervals throughout the deposit. A series of ring patterns is drilled and blasted from each sublevel and broken ore is mucked out after each blast. Sublevel Caving can be used in orebodies with very different properties and is an easy method to mechanize.
