 · From the XRD pattern the initially sharp diffraction lines are considerably broadened after ball milling due to a decrease in the particle size and an increase in internal lattice strains. The peak broadening of XRD peaks particularly (102202) peak and creation of particles of sizes ~15nm are features suggestive of creation of nano-decagonal phase.

## Size Reduction 
Size reduction in attrition mills occurs through the scraping of one surface against another. Particles scrape against each other or against a rigid face. In general the size of the resulting particles can get near the micrometer level but in the pharmaceutical industry demand has increased for particles on the nanometer level.

## 5 Grinding Considerations for 
 · Reducing the grit size will likely mean that feed rates will need to be reduced and as a result cycle times could increase. Smaller grit sizes cannot remove material at as high of a removal rate as coarser grit sizes. Also thermal damage might be induced in a workpiece when using smaller grit sizes.

## Ball Mill 
Ball mills give a controlled final grind and produce flotation feed of a uniform size. Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel.
