## Introduction to Short Circuit Analysis
Electrons flow through the short (a path of almost zero resistance) and the remainder of the circuit by passing through the 10-ohm resistor and the battery. The amount of current flow increases greatly because its resistive path has decreased from 10000 ohms to 10 ohms. Due to the excessive current flow the 10-ohm resistor becomes heated.
