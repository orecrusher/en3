## Quarrying 
Matching explosive energy to geology enables expanded patterns without affecting fragmentation. This in turn increases the drilling yield providing more tonnes per drill metre. Products and procedures for safely sleeping blasts allow less frequent and larger blasts reducing production delays and increasing blasted inventory without employing more drills or blast crew resources.
