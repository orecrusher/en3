## Ball Mills 
A Ball Mill grinds material by rotating a cylinder with steel grinding balls causing the balls to fall back into the cylinder and onto the material to be ground. The rotation is usually between 4 to 20 revolutions per minute depending upon the diameter of the mill. The larger the diameter the slower the rotation.
