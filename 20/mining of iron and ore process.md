The main goal for the processing of iron ore is to take the ore extracted during the mining effort break the ore into usable units and then purify those units before the actual smelting begins. Doing so makes it easier to produce a higher grade of iron that in turn can be used to create materials for use in everything from manufacturing lawn furniture to cookware to building materials.
