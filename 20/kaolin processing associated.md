 · Kaolin also known as porcelain stone is a kind of clay and clay rock dominated by kaolinite clay minerals. It belongs to non-metallic minerals and is an aggregate of water-containing aluminosilies composed of multiple minerals. The pure kaolin is white fine soft and soft with good plasticity and fire resistance and other physical and chemical properties.

## What is Ball Clay? 
Kaolin ('china clay') produces a very white color when it is fired but used alone it is brittle and weak and must be mixed with ball clay to produce a workable malleable raw material. As a result of their sedimentary origin raw ball clays have a wide range of colors.

When the kaolin is first released it is likely to contain dark and abrasive impurities. Processing steps can include sieving centrifugal cleaning magnetic removal of dark contaminants and bleaching. After these processes the particles of kaolin is still likely to resemble "books" comprised of layers.

The Cornish Alps began to dominate the landscape as every ton of usable china clay that was mined brought with it five tonnes of waste. Railways and tramways were built to transport the material to the coast. By 1910 Cornwall was producing some fifty per cent of the world's china clay something in the region of one million tonnes every year
