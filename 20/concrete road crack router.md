## What causes a concrete pavement to crack? 
If the crack travels around the coarse aggregate particles it is most likely that the crack formed at a very early age before the cement paste was able to bond sufficiently to the aggregates. For example this may occur when the subbase contracts from a reduction in temperature and induces reflective cracks in the concrete at an early age.
