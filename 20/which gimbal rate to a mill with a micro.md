## 5 Best Milling Machines 
Cheap mills do exist but we have serious doubts about their durability and ability to produce accurate results. A good micro mill that would satisfy the demands of miniaturists and model makers will cost between $400 and $500. If you were to opt for something a little larger or with a digital readout you could easily spend $1000 on a micro mill.

## Groove or slot milling 
Groove or slot milling. Groove or slot milling is an operation in which side and face milling is often preferred to end milling. Slots or grooves can be short or long closed or open straight or non-straight deep or shallow wide or narrow. Tool selection is normally determined by the width and depth of the groove and to some extent length.
