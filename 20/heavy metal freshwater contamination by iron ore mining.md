Heavy metal pollution of surface and underground water sources results in considerable soil pollution and pollution increases when mined ores are dumped on the ground surface for manual dressing (Garbarino et al. 1995; INECAR 2000). Surface dumping exposes the metals to air and rain thereby generating much AMD. When

lution concerns in the mining industry. Removal of overburden to access the ore can pose major problems in storage and reclamation. The over-burden (waste-to-ore) ratio for surface mining of metal ores generally ranges from 2:1 to 8:1 de-pending on local conditions. The ratio for solid wastes from underground mining is typically 0.2:1.

 · Although consumption of key metals including iron ore (steel) and base metals will grow over the next few decades the rampant growth witnessed during the decade prior to 2014 is unlikely to return. We expect waning Chinese demand increasing metal substitution and recycling to all play a part in consolidating this long-term trend.
