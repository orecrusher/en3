## Iron ore 
Iron makes up close to 5% of the Earth's crust. It takes around 1.6 tons of iron ore to produce one ton of steel. The chemical symbol for iron is 'Fe' because of its Latin name Ferrum. We use 20 times more iron (in the form of steel) than all other metals put together. Our iron ore trains are over 2.5km (264 ore cars) long meaning it can take

## Direct reduced iron process 
 · Direct reduced iron (DRI) process. In addition to the process route via the blast furnace process there is another option for extracting crude steel from iron ores using the so-called direct reduced iron (DRI) process (secondary route).The starting point for the efforts to find an alternative to the blast furnace process was the relatively high process expenditure.
