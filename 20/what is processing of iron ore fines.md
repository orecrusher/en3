 · A vast reserve of iron ore fines exists in the tailing dam that contain up to 60% Fe. The ore is mainly hematite. The wet processing plant (5 million tonnes per year capacity) loed at the mine site produces −40+10 mm lumps for use in blast furnace −10 mm+100 mesh fines for the sinter plant and the −100 mesh is disposed as tailings.

## What Is Iron Ore Sintering? (with pictures)
Iron ore sintering is a type of powder metallurgy used to pre-treat iron before using it in manufacturing appliions. Sintering involves heating iron powder to partially but not completely melt the iron particles. The exact process used and additional elements involved vary with some methods using gas or electricity in addition to heat.

 · The making of cast iron begins with a combination of raw materials. Iron is rarely found in its pure form. Only meteorites contain pure iron. The iron in use for centuries is found in the combination of iron and other elements. These combinations are known as iron oxides. Mining pulls most of the iron from iron ores
