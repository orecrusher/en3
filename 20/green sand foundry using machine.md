## Green Sand: An Introduction to Its Use in Foundries 
Green sand is a compound mixture used for casting of metals in foundry appliions as a mould. It is 'green' not by colour but takes the moniker due to the fact that it is not 'set' when the metal is poured into it rather it is still in the 'green' or uncured state.

## What are Green Sand Castings? 
Green Sand Castings are castings made using wet sand or "green sand" molds. The sand is not green in color nor do the molds use "greensand" a greenish color sandstone. Instead the sand is called "green" because it has moisture in it before the sand dries out for casting. Learn more!

## Foundry Sand: Life of a Casting 
Green sand is not called that because of its color—these materials can be a wide range of colors depending on composition and use. Instead it gets its name because it is damp like green wood. Mechanical aspects of the sand are measured before being used on the foundry floor.
