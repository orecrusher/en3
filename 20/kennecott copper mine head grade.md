## Some observations on copper yields and ore grades 
There is no apparent correlation between average grade and deposit size but mine operators tend to exploit economies of scale to offset low grades. The relationship between the annual percentage yields (the head grade) and the reserve grades of deposits is not static. In recent years head grades have fallen closer to reserve grades.
