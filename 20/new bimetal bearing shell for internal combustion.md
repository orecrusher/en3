## A Quick Guide to Engine Bearings 
 · In the early days of the internal combustion engine bearings were made out of a very soft material called Babbitt which is a very soft alloy of lead copper and tin. This material came from the manufacturer not as a bearing insert but as an ingot that was then melted and poured into a connecting rod and then machined.

## Types of Engine Bearing Damage 
The bearing material must be extremely strong because of the stresses caused by the explosions inside the internal combustion engine. Reducing friction is accomplished in part by the fact that dissimilar metals slide against each other with less friction and wear than similar materials will.
