## Sunflower Processing 
Extracted and desolventized sunflower oil must be further processed to make an edible product. Edible oils are refined to improve the flavor odor color and stability using processes that degum neutralize bleach and deodorize the oil. These refining processes remove contaminants such as phosphatides free fatty acids and pro-oxidants.
