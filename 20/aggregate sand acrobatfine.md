## What Is Fine Aggregate 
Fine aggregates are essentially any natural sand particles won from the land through the mining process. Fine aggregates consist of natural sand or any crushed stone particles that are ¼" or smaller.This product is often referred to as 1/4'" minus as it refers to the size or grading of this particular aggregate.

## Difference Between Gravel and Sand 
 · Though sand and gravels are construction materials they have some different characteristics embedded on them. – Particle sizes of soil in gravel range from 4.75mm to 76.2mm while particle sizes of soil in sand range from 0.075mm to 4.75mm. That means soil particles in gravel are larger than that of sand. – Bearing capacity of gravel is
