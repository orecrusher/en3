## Using Ball Mills to Extract Raw Gold from Ores 
 · The ore is sent into a single-cylinder hydraulic cone crusher for the secondary crushing. Thereafter the gold ore is transferred to a multi-cylinder hydraulic cone crusher where the ore is crushed further into finer material. From there the crushed gold ore is sent to a ball mill evenly as it passes through a vibrating screen for grinding.

## Bond Work Index 
The Bond work index is not solely a material constant but is influenced by the grinding conditions. For example the finer the grind size desired the higher is the kWh/t required to grind to that size. Magdalinovic [38] measured the Bond work index of three ore types using different test screen sizes. He produced a correlation between the mass of test screen undersize per revolution G and
