## Aluminium 
Aluminium is made from bauxite or aluminium ore. Bauxite is the basic raw material that is refined into alumina which in turn is sent to smelters for processing into aluminium. First discovered near Les Beaux in the South of France in 1821 bauxite was initially called "beauxite".

## Aluminium 
 · The use of recycled aluminum saves 95 percent of the energy and avoids 95 percent of the emissions associated with the production of the metal from ore and it reduces the amount of waste consigned to landfills With appropriate sorting scrap aluminium can advantageously be recycled to produce the same sorts of products over and over again. Requires only 5% of the original energy input.
