Beginning in the mid 1980s a new technology commonly known as the leach-solvent extraction-electrowinning process or SX/EW Process was widely adopted. This new copper technology utilizes smelter acid to produce copper from oxidized ores and mine wastes. Today worldwide approximately 20% of all copper produced is produced by this is process.

## Dual Filter Media for Solvent Extraction Electrowinning 
One of the leading methods of extracting metals such as copper from their ores is solvent extraction and electrowinning (SXEW). This process can be enhanced by the use of garnet-anthracite dual filter media prior to the electrowinning step affording significantly improved results from the final electrochemical process.

High extraction efficiencies can be achieved at elevated eluate temperatures of approximately 70°C. This is due to a combination of lower dissolved oxygen content reduced solution viscosity and increased ionic mobility at higher temperatures. However a maximum electrolyte operating temperature of 90°C can be tolerated in the Electrowinning
