## Hematite 
Iron ore is a mineral substance which when heated in the presence of a reductant will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (Fe2O3). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey bright yellow or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 72.4% Fe) hematite (Fe 2 O 3 69.9% Fe) goethite (FeO(OH) 62.9% Fe) limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O) 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO
