Ball mills are normally operated at around 75% of critical speed so a mill with diameter 5 metres will turn at around 14 rpm. The mill is usually divided into at least two chambers (although this depends upon feed input size - mills including a roller press are mostly single-chambered) allowing the use of different sizes of grinding media.

## Critical speed analysis for nonlinear effects of rotor 
 · The critical speed analysis for nonlinear effects of rotor-bearing system and ball end milling are studied in this paper. The nonlinear cutting force can be calculated by using the Tlusty proposed 3/4 rule for chip thickness. The rotor system is supported by bearings with nonlinear spring effects. The critical speeds obtained from this study are compared with two sets of experimental data

## Ball mill factors
Speed of rotation of mill; at low speeds the balls simply roll over one another and little grinding is obtained while at very high speeds the balls are simply carried along the walls of the shells and little or no grinding takes place so for an effective grinding the ball mill should be operated at a speed that is optimum speed equal to 50 to 75 percent of the critical speed (the minimum

## Critical Speed of Ball Mill 
 · Critical Speed of Ball MillFor a ball mill it does not have a constant critical speed because of the centrifugalization of the steel balls is different according to different resistance and friction between ball loads.But the ball speed of centrifugalization is constant.
