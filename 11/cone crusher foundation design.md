## Crusher 
A cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle which is covered by a wear-resistant mantle and the enclosing concave hopper covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner.
