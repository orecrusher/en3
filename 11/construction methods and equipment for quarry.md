## What Is Quarrying of Stones 
What Is Quarrying of Stones? You must have heard the word mine and quarry. The operations of taking out the materials from the ground at great depths are known as mining whereas in the case of the quarry the operations for taking out the match as (Stone) are carried out at ground level in an exposed condition.. The process of taking out stones from the natural rock is known as "quarrying

## Best Management Practices for Quarry Operations
 · Quarrying requires substantial heavy equipment equipment-maintenance areas and refueling operations and often includes associated facilities such as concrete or asphalt batch plants. The act of removing rock reduces the separation between these activities and the water table making the groundwater system much more vulnerable.

## Health And Safety In Quarrying 
The quarrying industry is a noisy industry. The QPA3 states that typical noise levels could be between 89–108dB (A) for a primary crusher and 106–110dB (A) for hand drills. The principle health effect of being exposed to high levels of noise in the long term is noise-induced hearing loss.
