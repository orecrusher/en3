## Forces 
Types of Forces: The boy can grip and move the ball in control because of friction and how the ball is designed to have channels (black grooves) in order to provide a more stable grip. He applies a force downward and the ball falls to the ground with the help of gravity. When the ball is only in the air only the force of gravity is acting on it.

## SIZE REDUCTION 
At low speeds the ball roll over each other and attrition (rubbing action) will be the predominate mode of action. Thus in the ball mill impact or attrition or both are responsible for the size reduction. Advantages: It can produce very fine powder. Ball mill is used for both wet and dry grinding processes.

## What is the direction of the friction force on a rolling ball?
Now introduce friction: you have kinematic friction slowing down this point thus make the ball roll due to the induced torque. You will have a motion in between the cases of pure sliding and pure rolling. In this case the direction of the friction force is obvious (by definition of the friction).

Abstract This paper presents the development and verifiion of a predictive model for the force system in ball-end milling. The force model is essentially derived from metal cutting theory and for the geometric relations of the ball-end milling process. A concise method for characterizing the complex geometry of a ball-end mill is first determined.
