## Crushing in Mineral Processing
 · In mineral processing or metallurgy the first stage of comminution is crushing.. Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate/surface.
