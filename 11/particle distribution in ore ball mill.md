In a ball mill. it is quite probable that any particle or particles can be impacted by a ball and be broken. Thus not only feed particles but also the fragments from broken feed will be comminuted by the balls. Thus the product from a ball mill will be a mixture of the products from these different kinds of

## Particle
The particle-size distribution (PSD) of a powder or granular material or particles dispersed in fluid is a list of values or a mathematical function that defines the relative amount typically by mass of particles present according to size. Significant energy is usually required to disintegrate soil etc. particles into the PSD that is then called a grain size distribution.
