 · So compressive strength is the highest load per unit area borne by the stone without giving in. A higher compressive strength between1800 psi (12.45 MPa) and 19000 psi (131 MPa) means the stone can endure an upper crushing load. Dry or wet conditions as per load determine the compressive strength of the stone. Bending strength

Crushed granite stone is made of hard grainy rock. Granite is mainly composed of feldspar and mica crystals whose concentration does not influence the color and tone of the stone. The rock mass is usually obtained by blasting a monolithic rock face and broken further on with a crusher whilst produced crushed material is screened per fractions (sizes).

## Difference Between M Sand Vs River Sand 
M Sand is nothing but artificial sand made from crushing of rock or granite for construction purposes in cement or concrete. M sand differs from natural river sand in its physical and mineralogical properties. Sand is one of the important ingredients at making concrete mortar plaster etc.. Earth scientists and organizations are now promoting the use of M-Sand(Manufactured Sand).
