Clean gravels and crushed rock are sometimes referred to as "self-compacting" meaning that if they are dumped in beside a pipe the material will have a high density. Owners engineers contractors and inspectors have been known to use this expression. Some even claim that dumping in gravel and crushed rock will result in 95 percent

One may ask "how many tonnes in a yard of gravel?" it's depends on wet and moist condition and density of gravel for estimating purpose generally a cubic yard of gravel weighs around 3000 pounds and 1 ton or tonne is equal to 2000 pounds so number of tonnes in a yard of gravel such as 3000/ 2000 = 1.5 tons hence there are 1.5 tonnes or tons in a yard of gravel.

Density is also called as unit weight of substance. It is represented by symbol called row ( p). Density represents the degree of compactness of material. If the material is of more density it is more compacted material. Density is defined as the ratio of mass to volume. p = m/v Units = kg/m 3 or lb/ft 3 Conversion: 1 kg/m 3 = 0.624 lb/ft 3.
