## Limestone quarry quarrying cement raw materials
Cement manufacturing begins with quarrying operations in which limestone in mines is quarried and brought to crusher for crushing. Limestone quarries are opencast mines. Often limestone appears as an outcrop right on the surface. At other times it is under an overburden that can vary in depth but is generally less than 3 metres thick.

The cement manufacturing process involves four distinct stages and these are outlined below. Step 1 - Quarrying The raw material for cement manufacture is a rock mixture which is about 80% limestone (which is rich in CaCO3) and 20% clay or shale (a source of silica alumina and Fe2O3). These are quarried and stored separately.

Raw materials used in cement manufacturing. If you happen to be a geologist the raw materials quarry is probably the most interesting part of a cement works maybe unless you view the clinkering process as igneous rocks in the making.

## Raw materials for cement manufacturing
Lime Component Limestone: Common forms of calcium carbonate used as raw material for cement manufacturing are limestone and chalk.Limestone is of predominantly fine grained crystalline structure its hardness is between 1.8 to 3.0 of the Mohs scale of hardness and specific gravity 2. To 2.8. Limestone usually contains admixtures of clay substance or iron compounds which influences its color.

## How A Quarry Works 
The process starts by breaking off large chunks of rock from the quarry walls usually through controlled blasting. This rock is then moved using loaders and trucks to a primary crusher. THE PRIMARY CRUSHER. The crusher reduces the overall size of the material to make it easier to process.
