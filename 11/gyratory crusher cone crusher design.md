The gyratory crusher has capacities starting from 1200 to above 5000 t/h. To have a feed opening corresponding to that of a jaw crusher the primary gyratory crusher must be much taller and heavier. Therefore primary gyratories require quite a massive foundation. The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher.
