 · In mineral processing or metallurgy the first stage of comminution is crushing.. Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate/surface.

## How Underground Mining Works 
The least common method in hard-rock mining block caving is typically saved for low-grade ore. It involves drilling a section of ore at the very bottom of the deposit and then blasting to make the roof collapse. Gravity then takes over as the ore above the blast site fractures and collapses in succession as support is withdrawn.

Gold deposits can be grouped into two primary classes: placer deposits where the gold is exposed from weathering and erosion and hard rock where the gold is still trapped within the host rock. Gold recovery methods for these two types of deposits vary greatly from simple panning to a complex network of grinding chemical leaching gravity concentration and more.

Removing the gold-bearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.
