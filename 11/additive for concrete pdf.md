As the concrete hardens the bubbles disintegrate or transform releasing the water which is absorbed into the cement matrix thus aiding in the hydration process and leaving air voids of similar sizes. Thus there is less need to wet the concrete during curing as is normally necessary with conventional unfoamed concrete.
