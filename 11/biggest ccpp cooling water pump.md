Water-cooled condensers involve a heat rejection loop where condenser heat is dissipated to the environment via water. The most common type of water-cooled condensers in geothermal power plants are direct-contact and surface types. Plate-type heat exchangers (a special kind of surface exchanger) are also possible but appear to be more common in liquid-to-liquid heat transfer appliions.
