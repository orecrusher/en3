## The Gauss. The strength of the magnetic field 
The Gauss. The strength of the magnetic field. The Gauss is nothing more than the unit used to measure the strength of a magnetic field and gaussmeter the instrument used to make that measurement. The higher the number of Gauss the more force the magnetic field will have so the greater the distance will be reached from the surrounding magnet.

## how to determine crushing strength of concrete
Not all concrete is the same strength. Before trying to determine how strong a pad is you must first know how strong the concrete is. This is normally measured as compression strength measured by pounds per square inch or psi. A common bag of concrete for example may have a compression strength of 4000 psi based on a thickness of 2

TENSILE STRENGTH is the measure of the force or stress required to pull something (resistance to lengthwise stress) to the point where it breaks or before permanent deformation results. Usually it is the maximum amount of tensile stress that it can be subjected to before failure although the definition of failure can vary according to material type and design methodology.
