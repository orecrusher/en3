## DC Machine 
What is a DC Machine? A DC machine is an electromechanical energy alteration device. The working principle of a DC machine is when electric current flows through a coil within a magnetic field and then the magnetic force generates a torque that rotates the dc motor. The DC machines are classified into two types such as DC generator as well as DC motor.

## How do tractors work? 
 · Tractors can pull or power implements (farm machines such as plows trailers hay balers manure spreaders and so on) in three different ways: using a simple drawbar with a much more sophistied three-way attachment called a hitch or (if the implement needs power) with a mechanized driveshaft called a power takeoff.

## How do submarines work? 
 · They work a bit like the wings and control surfaces (swiveling flaps) on an airplane creating an upward force called lift. Buoyancy is the tendency of something to sink rise or float at a certain depth. While it's underwater a submarine is negatively buoyant which means it tends to sink left to its own devices if it's not moving.
