## Compressive strength 
The compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence for this region = where this time E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.

## What is Compression Testing? 
Compression testing is one of the most fundamental types of mechanical testing alongside tensile and flexion tests. Compression tests are used to determine a material's behavior under applied crushing loads and are typically conducted by applying compressive pressure to a test specimen (usually of either a cuboid or cylindrical geometry) using platens or specialized fixtures on a universal
