## Reduction of Iron Oxides with Hydrogen—A Review 
Iron ores always contain some additional gangue. The type and amount depend on the iron ore itself and the beneficiation process. Typical remaining oxides are SiO 2 CaO MgO and Al 2 O 3. Wang and Sohn 43 investigated the effect of CaO and SiO 2 on swelling and iron whisker formation during the reduction of iron oxide compacts.
