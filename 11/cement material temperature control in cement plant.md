## Emissions from the Cement Industry 
 · Though "cement" and "concrete" are often used interchangeably concrete is actually the final product made from cement. The primary component of cement is limestone. To produce cement limestone and other clay-like materials are heated in a kiln at 1400°C and then ground to form a lumpy solid substance called clinker; clinker is then combined with gypsum to form cement.

## Cement manufacturing 
Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale. These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions. This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of about 1400 C to 1500 C.

Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium) sand and clay (silicon aluminum iron) shale fly ash mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.
