## Sieve Analysis Test Procedure And Calculation
Sieve Analysis Test Procedure and Calculation. The aggregates are graded as fine and coarse aggregate based on the grain size. When the aggregate size is greater than 4.75mm is called coarse aggregate and less than 4.75mm is called fine aggregate. The sieve analysis test will do the grading of aggregates.

A sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used in civil engineering and chemical engineering to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material by allowing the material to pass through a series of sieves of progressively smaller mesh size and weighing the amount of material that is stopped by each sieve as a fraction of the whole mass.

 · When coarse aggregates are used in NSC it is noticed that the failure of test cube is because of separation of aggregates from the paste surrounding it. This separation happens in the transition zone because the paste below the large size aggregate has more water and as such it becomes the weaker zone.

Grain Size Analysis of Aggregates Fine aggregate is the sand used in mortars. Coarse aggregate is the broken stone used in concrete .The coarse aggregate unless mixed with fine aggregate serves no purpose in cement works. The size of fine aggregate is limited to a maximum of 4.75 mm gauge beyond which it is known as coarse aggregate.

 · If any standard sieve is missing use the value of next higher sieve. Adding extra sieve does not change the value of FM. Fineness Modulus. It is the cumulative percentage retained on standard sieve 150μm or sieves No 100 and above divided by 100. It is a single factor or an empirical number which we get from the results of sieve analysis.
