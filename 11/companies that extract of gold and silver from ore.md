## How Gold Is Refined: A Step
Even once the gold has been extracted from the earth it's still in its raw form. It's still just raw ore that requires processing before it becomes pure gold. First the ore is crushed. It then undergoes a series of processes that will vary depending on the different elements and minerals that are mixed in with the gold ore.

## Smelting and Roasting Ores to recover gold silver and 
The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.
