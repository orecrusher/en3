## Those 96 Million Black Balls in LA's Reservoir Are Not 
 · In a new episode from Veritasium Derek Muller investigates the story behind this wild idea. "It looks absurd" Muller laughs in the video. "It's like we're in the world's biggest ball pit." He's not wrong. Even from the middle of the reservoir the boat where the presenter stands seems to be borne aloft not by the water below but by the sea of spheres blanketing its surface.
