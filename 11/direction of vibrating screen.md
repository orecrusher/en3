 · Rotation direction can dramatically impact incline screen performance. Running counter flow or uphill increases material retention time and action on the screen potentially giving the particles more opportunity to find an opening – and ultimately increasing efficiency. Direction of rotation has little effect on a linear-type horizontal screen.
