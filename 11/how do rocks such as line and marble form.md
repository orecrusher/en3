Ores are rocks that include minerals that have important elements such as metals like gold and silver. Sedimentary rocks form layers at the bottoms of oceans and lakes. Marble is a metamorphic rock formed when limestone is exposed to high heat and pressure within the Earth. Layers of sedimentary rocks are called strata.

Marble formation takes place over thousands of years by heat from the magma in the earth's crust. It is created when limestone or dolostone comes in contact with the magma and becomes superheated to extreme temperatures. The calcite in the limestone crystallizes and that is why you see shiny specks and layers within the rock.

Marble is a rock made of calcium carbonate which has been exposed to a natural recrystallization process.. Marble is being created by the transformation of other stones through the action of high temperatures and intense pressures. As a result of this process new minerals textures and structures give rise to a large number of different types of marble as we will see in the examples below.

When you engrave a rock the engraved lines will be lighter in color than the rock itself. So while engraving might stand out especially well on dark-colored stone it won't be any more or less difficult to do.

## How do you recognize limestone and marble? [USGS]
How do you recognize limestone and marble? The main difference between limestone and marble is that limestone is a sedimentary rock typically composed of calcium carbonate fossils and marble is a metamorphic rock. Limestone forms when shells sand and mud are deposited at the bottom of oceans and lakes and over time solidify into rock.

 · The Bible says "On that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up" ( Genesis 7:11 ). At the start of the Flood cracks appeared in the crust.

## How is marble formed step by step? – AnswersToAll
 · How is marble formed step by step? Marble forms when limestone experiences metamorphism. Usually this happens at a convergent tectonic plate boundary but some marble forms when hot magma heats limestone or dolomite. The heat or pressure recrystallizes calcite in the rock changing its texture.

Igneous rocks form when molten rock (magma or lava) cools and solidifies. Sedimentary rocks originate when particles settle out of water or air or by precipitation of minerals from water. They accumulate in layers. Metamorphic rocks result when existing rocks are changed by heat pressure or reactive fluids such as hot mineral-laden water. Most rocks are made of minerals containing silicon

## What is Marble and how is it formed? Baltimore
Marble is a rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals with the maximum concentration of calcite or dolomite.Marble begins life as sedimentary rock known as limestone which is a soft stone made primarily of calcite. Sedimentary rock is formed at or near the Earth's surface by the accumulation and lithifiion of sediment (detrital rock).

## A Very Simple Metamorphic Classifiion
Compositionally simple sedimentary rocks such as quartz sandstone and limestone (calcite) do not change composition with metamorphism - their chemistry is too simple. Quartz remains quartz and calcite remains calcite. The rocks do recrystallize though forming granular rocks with fused grains; the rocks quartzite and marble.
