## Energy Audit Of A Boiler
In the case of industries such as power plants the energy conservation is must. In this study our attention is focused on Energy auditing. Energy audit serves to identify all the energy streams into a facility quantify energy use according to discrete function. Energy audit is a vital link in the entire energy management chain.

## Energy Audit 
Energy audit: Definition and Types Energy audit is a systematic study or survey to identify how energy is being used in a building or plant and identifies energy savings opportunities. Using proper audit methods and equipment an energy audit provides the energy manager with essential information on how much where and how energy is used within an organization (factory or building).

The primary source of all energy on planet Earth is from the sun - plants get energy from the sun for photosynthesis and we/otheranimals eat the plants to gain energy heat from the sun also drives atmospheric circulation which controls the wind tides and waves. Solar power is power generated directly from sunlight.

## Energy audits in industrial processes 
 · Audits vary widely in their level of detail. Depending on comprehensive audits and the plant's energy profile various energy audit tools are used. By using a checklist that includes the major areas for energy consumption an individual can take a baseline measurement take notes and identify the areas where obvious improvements can be made.

## Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and Energy Purchase 
A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) secures the payment stream for a Build-Own Transfer (BOT) or concession project for an independent power plant (IPP). It is between the purchaser "offtaker" (often a state-owned electricity utility) and a privately owned power producer. The PPA outlined here is not appropriate for electricity sold on the world spot markets (see Deregulated Electricity Markets
