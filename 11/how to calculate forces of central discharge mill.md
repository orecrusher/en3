 · If you have a typical cooling water discharge pressure of around 300 kPag you could get a flow of 74 m 3 /minute and a velocity of 17 m/s. The velocity head would be about 140 kPa. If this is the pressure in the plane through the open discharge then applying it to the pipe cross sectional area gives a force of 10 kN or about 1000 kgf.

## Mill (grinding) 
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding crushing or cutting. Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them. Historically mills were powered by hand or by animals (e.g. via a hand crank) working animal (e.g. horse mill) wind or water ().

## General Thrust Equation 
 · Across the exit area we may encounter an additional force term equal to the exit area Ae times the exit pressure minus the free stream pressure. The general thrust equation is then given by: F = (m dot  V)e - (m dot  V)0 + (pe - p0)  Ae. Normally the magnitude of the pressure-area term is small relative to the m dot-V terms.

## Cutting Forces Calculation and Experimental Measurement 
 · Abstract. Calculation technique for cutting forces prediction in 5-axis ball end milling is worked out and realized as computational program. The curvilinear cutting edge is divided into small segments and the path for each segment is defined. The local cutting forces are than calculated from local chip thickness using mechanistic approach.

For an object in free fall so that gravity is the only force acting on it then the expression for weight follows from Newton's second law.. You might well ask as many do "Why do
