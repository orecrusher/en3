## leach heap leach extraction in gold mines
This process called the "leach cycle" generally takes from one or two months for simple oxide ores (e.g. most gold ores) to two years for nickel laterite ores. The leach solution containing the dissolved minerals is then collected treated in a process plant to recover the target mineral and in some cases precipitate other minerals and recycled to the heap after reagent levels are adjusted.
