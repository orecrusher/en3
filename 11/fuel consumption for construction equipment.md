## Where do I deduct fuel used for construction equipment?
 · Where do I deduct fuel used for construction equipment? For Schedule C there is not a specific section set aside to handle fuel costs for business equipment such as what you described. In order to keep track of it for your own benefit on your return it might make the most sense to list the diesel fuel cost on its own under the Less Common Expenses section using the Other Miscellaneous

## Modeling and Optimizing Fuel Usage of On
 · Equipment operations account for more than 50% of fuel use as well as emission production in the construction industry. Currently construction firms have investigated into engine technologies and fuel attributes for reducing the fuel consumption which may not be economical and can hardly be applied to the existing fleet of equipment.
