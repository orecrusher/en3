## A review of zinc oxide mineral beneficiation using 
 · At present zinc is produced from zinc sulfide minerals which are the primary source of zinc and it is easy to separate the sulfide minerals from the gangue using conventional flotation techniques. As sulfide ores become depleted with the passage of time the beneficiation of oxidized zinc ores has assumed great importance in recent years.

The properties of a lead-zinc ore are investigated by XRD and SEM analysis methods. Results show that the ore assays 1.27 per cent Pb and 1.62 per cent Zn mainly occurring in the form of sulfide minerals. Through lead and zinc phase analysis it is known that the distribution of galena reaches 63.78 per cent and that of sphalerite is up to 77.16 per cent.

 · Because of this close association of zinc and lead ores it is necessary to consider them together in discussing their concentration. An earlier summary of practices and costs of concentrating lead and zinc ores was published by the Bureau of Mines in 1935. Most of the data in the present bulletin were abstracted from the earlier publiion.
