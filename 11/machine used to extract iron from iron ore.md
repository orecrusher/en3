## Iron Mining Process 
The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism. The remaining rock is waste material and is dumped into tailings basins. The taconite powder with the iron in it is called concentrate. Pellets The concentrate (the wet taconite powder) is rolled with clay inside large rotating cylinders.

## Iron 
Iron ores are rocks from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. Most deposits of iron ore in the world are found in rocks known as banded iron formations (BIFs). These are sedimentary rocks that have alternating layers of iron-rich minerals and a fine-grained silica rock called chert.

Extraction of Metals. Extraction of Iron.. Iron is extracted from its ore in the blast furnace.. The main iron ore is called haematite. Haematite is iron(III) oxide - Fe 2 O 3. The iron ore contains impurities mainly silica (silicon dioxide). Limestone (calcium carbonate) is added to the iron ore which reacts with the silica to form molten calcium silie in the blast furnace.
