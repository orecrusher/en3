## Copper Smelting Chemistry Tutorial 
Mining produce ores containing 2% or less of copper. Concentrating the ore by froth flotation can result in ores with up to 35% copper. A collector oil such as an organic xanthate or thiophosphate is added to the powdered ore and adheres strongly to the chalcopyrite particles making them water repellant.

Extracting copper. Extracting copper. Picture 4. A copper mine. The size of the trucks in the picture give an idea of the scale. The copper ore has to be dug from the ground. The ore contains some copper mineral and lot of waste rock. The copper mine in picture 4 produces 6 tonnes of copper from every 1000 tonnes of ore.

## The Extraction of Copper 
 · Extracting of Copper from Other Ores. Copper can be extracted from non-sulfide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulfuric acid to produce a very dilute copper

## Electrowinning Copper Chemistry Tutorial
Copper ores are usually copper oxides copper sulfides or copper carbonates. Most copper oxide ores do not contain a high enough percentage of copper to make direct smelting of the ore economically viable. Electrowinning can be used to extract the copper from these copper oxide ores.

## Current Energy Requirements in the Copper Producing 
 · An analysis of energy usage in the production of refined hode copper was made from mining ore to hode copper. In mining copper ore the greatest energy consumers are ore hauling and blasting. Another important factor is the "recovery efficiency" of the metallurgical processes used to extract the copper. The mining and mineral concentrating energies are directly proportional to the
