In migmatite you can see metamorphic rock that has reached the limits of metamorphism and begun transitioning into the igneous stage of the rock cycle by melting to form magma.

## The Quartz Page: Quartz as a Rock
For example a rock that is entirely made of albite NaAlSi 3 O 8 a feldspar has 0% quartz content but contains 77.3% silica (weight percent).. It was once customary to express the chemical composition of a mineral as an oxide formula (mostly because the structural relationships between the elements involved were not precisely known) and it is still useful if one reflects the silica content.
