## Iron Ore Mining 
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
