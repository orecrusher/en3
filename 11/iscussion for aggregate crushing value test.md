Mechanical Properties of Aggregates Aggregate Crushing Value Test Discussion • There is no explicit relation between the aggregate crushing value and its compressive strength but in general the crushing value is greater for a lower compressive strength. BS 812: Part 3 specifies a maximum limit of 30 for aggregates used in structural concrete and 40 on aggregates used in lean concrete.
