## Ball Milling 
Ball milling is a size reduction technique that uses media in a rotating cylindrical chamber to mill materials to a fine powder. As the chamber rotates the media is lifted up on the rising side and then cascades down from near the top of the chamber. With this motion the particles in between the media and chamber walls are reduced in size by
