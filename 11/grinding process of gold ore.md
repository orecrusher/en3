## Processes 
Focussing on the gold industry Gekko replace high-energy whole ore treatment of gold by carbon-in-leach (CIL) methodologies with beneficial low-energy process solutions. Harnessing both gravity separation and floatation as well as dramatically reducing the initial mass to be processed by pre-concentration Gekko flowsheets increase the grade for downstream intensive processing.

The Mining Process A slurry of ground ore water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved Following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver.

 · Metallurgical processing of metalliferous ores in general and gold ores in particular consists essentially of three stages often colloquially referred to as: Bashing (crushing); Mashing (grinding); and. Hashing (extraction/recovery) In the context of flowsheet selection the bashing and mashing stages are relatively straightforward.

This refractory nature of the ore led to inefficiencies recovering the gold from ore in the past. The ore now goes through a three-stage processing cycle to ensure the gold is economically recovered from the ore. Stage 1: Crushing and Grinding. Ore stockpiled from underground and open pit mines is fed into the primary crusher at the process plant.

## Gold 
Free-milling ore is the name for when gold can be recovered by crushing grinding and cyanidation (treatment with a dilute cyanide solution) without additional processing. In refractory ore the gold is locked in sulphide minerals so to achieve satisfactory levels of gold recovery additional processing is required before cyanidation.
