What Is Slurry Seal. Slurry seal is a cold mix paving system that can remedy a broad range of problems on streets airfields parking lots and driveways Think of Slurry Seal as an Industrial Grade Asphalt Surfacing The principal materials used to create slurry are aggregate asphalt emulsion and fillers which are mixed together according to a laboratory's mix.

## » Slurry Seal
Slurry seal is a mixture of aggregate asphalt emulsion and filler which are mixed together according to a laboratory's design-mix formula. water is also added for workability. Asphalt emulsions serve as a binder holding the crushed aggregate together and adhering the new slurry surfacing to the old surface over which it is being applied.

## Tack Coat And Prime Coat Appliions With Asphalt 
Tack coat (also known as bond coat) is a light appliion of asphalt emulsion between hot mix asphalt layers designed to create a strong adhesive bond without slippage. Heavier appliions may be used under porous layers or around patches where it also functions as a seal coat.

## Asphalt Slurry Seal Micro
Slurry seal is a cold mix coating consisting of fine crushed aggregate emulsified asphalt additives and water applied to roadways. Emulsion serves as a binder to hold the aggregate together and to adhere to the roadway. Slurry seal is very economical and extends the life of pavement up to 7 years.
