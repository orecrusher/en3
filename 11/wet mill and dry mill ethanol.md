## Ethanol Production 
Traditionally ethanol from corn has primarily been produced through dry- and wet-milling processes. The majority of U.S. ethanol production is from dry-grind technology. The traditional dry-grind process grinds the whole corn kernel and mixes it with water and enzymes. The mash is then cooked to liquefy the starch further.
