## What is the process of mining coal? 
Coal Mining and Processing. Coal miners use giant machines to remove coal from the ground. They use two methods: surface or underground mining. Once the mining is finished the dirt and rock are returned to the pit the topsoil is replaced and the area is replanted.

## Mining 
 · Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal gold or iron ore.Iron ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times. Prehistoric people first mined flint which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

Throughout the mining and processing of minerals the mined ore undergoes a number of crushing grinding cleaning drying and product sizing operations as it is processed into a marketable commodity. These operations are highly mechanized and both individually and collectively these processes can generate large amounts of dust.
