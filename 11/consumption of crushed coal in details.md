## Coal preparation and storage 
 · Coal is reduced in size by crushing and pulverizing. Pre-crushed coal can be economical for smaller units especially those which are stoker fired. In a coal handling system crushing is limited to a maximum size of 6 or 4 mm. The most commonly used devices for crushing are the rotary breaker the roll crusher and the hammer mill.

## Fossil Fuel Consumption and the Environment
Energy consumption is intimately bound up with the natural environment. As "green" issues come to the forefront of political debate energy consumption patterns should also come under close scrutiny. This paper describes the major links between commercial energy consumption and the environment focussing especially on fossil fuels.

## Uses of Coal 
Coal is something that we might have come across at least once in our lifetime. It is a common substance used in many homes and even in big industries. That being said we will be studying about coal and some of its uses here. Coal is basically a combustible sedimentary rock usually occurring in parts known as coal beds or coal seams.

## Coal 
Coal is a black or brownish-black sedimentary rock that can be burned for fuel and used to generate electricity.It is composed mostly of carbon and hydrocarbons which contain energy that can be released through combustion (burning). Coal is the largest source of energy for generating electricity in the world and the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States.
