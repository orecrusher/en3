## MILLING CONTROL OPTIMISATION
SEGREGATED ORE FEED CONTROL (Feed Ratio Optimisation) On milling plants fed by a segregated feed supply such as a stockpile the varying size and hardness of the mill feed material affects the residence time in the mill and the power drawn. When the load becomes critically high the feed needs to be cut in order to "grind the mill out".

## Iron Processing 
Inside the ball mill the crushed iron ore will grind the ore to about 0.2 mm with 3-inch steel balls. 3.This iron ore slurry is pumped to the agitation tank. This iron ore slurry is finally pumped to the flotation machine with the fine sulfide ore (~-0.074 mm) going to froth flotation cells for recovery of iron.

## Ball Mill Operation 
 · The grinding circuit operator must ensure that the ball mill runs properly loaded and gives the correct ore grind. A major practical indiion of mill loading is the sound made by the mill. A properly loaded mill will have a deep rhythmic roar while an under loaded mill will have a metallic rattling type noise and an overloaded mill will be quite silent.
