## Focusing a Gaussian Laser Beam:Which Formula to Use 
 · When focusing a laser or anything for that matter there's a handy formula that is used to calculate the focus size and position.. It is generally called the thin lens formula and it looks like this: where s is the object distance s" is the image distance and f is the focal length of the lens. This is nice and simple but it's not quite correct when we consider Gaussian light beams.

 · A 2-by-8 beam would be sufficient. Consequently how do you size a steel beam for a house? Measure the distance in inches that you need the steel beam to fill. Write this figure down on a sheet of paper as your clear span for the beam. Measure the length in inches of the floor joist that the I-beam must support. Divide that number by two.

## What is section modulus? / Mechanical Stress (2021) 
 · A beam that has a larger section modulus than another will be stronger and capable of supporting greater loads. It includes the idea that most of the work in bending is being done by the extreme fibres of the beam ie the top and bottom fibres of the section. The distance of the fibres from top to bottom is therefore built into the calculation.
