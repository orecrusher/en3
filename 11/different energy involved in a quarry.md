## What are the safest and cleanest sources of energy? 
 · In 2018 87% of global CO 2 emissions came from fossil fuels and industry. 3. All energy sources have negative effects. But they differ enormously in size: as we will see in all three aspects fossil fuels are the dirtiest and most dangerous while nuclear and modern renewable energy sources are vastly safer and cleaner.

## The role of energy density in the overconsumption of fat
In recent years research has focused on why fat is so readily overconsumed. Although the palatability of many high fat foods can encourage overconsumption another possibility is that fat is not very satiating. A number of studies have compared the effects of fat and carbohydrate on both satiation
