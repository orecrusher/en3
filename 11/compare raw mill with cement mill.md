A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into "rawmix" during the manufacture of cement. Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln which transforms it into clinker which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement and has a large effect upon the

## Raw Mill Feeding 
Raw Mill Feeding. In the value stream map of cement manufacturing the raw mill feeding is an intermediate activity between Pre-homogenization and raw milling and has not been discussed separately by most of the authors. However in my opinion it remains and must remain as of pivotal importance so far as the quality assurance is considered.
