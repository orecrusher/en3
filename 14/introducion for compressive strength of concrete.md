## Factors affecting the compressive strength of the concrete 
Concrete strength is of two types; one is compressive strength while the other is the tensile strength of the concrete. The compressive strength is caused due to the material and cement used in concrete structures while the tensile strength is caused partially by concrete itself and a large part of this strength is caused by the reinforced material (steel iron) present in it.

The compressive strength is measured by breaking cylindrical concrete specimens in a compression-testing machine. The compressive strength is calculated from the failure load divided by the cross-sectional area resisting the load and reported in units of pound-force per square inch (psi) in US Customary units or megapascals (MPa) in SI units.

## Compressive strength of cement 
Strength is the most important property of cement. The compressive strength test of cement is done because with an increase in compressive strength of cement strengths such as flexural strength resistance to abrasion and so on also increases.With one test we can determine various aspects of cement and can decide the suitable types of cement for the construction site.
