## Ball Mill: Operating principles components Uses 
 · A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 – 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

## High
High-energy ball milling is a ball milling process in which a powder mixture placed in a ball mill is subjected to high-energy collisions from the balls. High-energy ball milling also called mechanical alloying can successfully produce fine uniform dispersions of oxide particles in nickel-base super alloys that cannot be made by conventional powder metallurgy methods.
