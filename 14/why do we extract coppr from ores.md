## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining Extraction
The barren rock or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore. By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper iron and sometimes other metals. Such ores originate from sulfur-bearing volcanic magmas which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.

Extract copper and gold from low-grade ores more efficiently. Ore deposits are becoming increasingly complex to treat and grades continue to deteriorate in known reserves. For instance approximately 15-20 per cent of the world's current gold production involves refractory ores that must be pre-treated prior to downstream recovery by cyanidation.
