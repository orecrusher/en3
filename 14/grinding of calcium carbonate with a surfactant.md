## SURFACE PROPERTIES OF NATURAL CALCITE FILLER TREATED 
Calcium carbonate is usually obtained by grinding of the natural mineral or of synthetic calcite prepared by carbonation of a calcium hydroxide solution [3]. Calcite the most abundant mineral on earth is one of the oldest manufactured powder while the precipitated calcium carbonate was first prepared almost a hundred years ago [4].

adsorption of ionic surfactants may be expected. To understand the mechanism of surfactant adsorption on carbonates and guide the selection of surfactants for EOR processes in carbonate reser-voirs we investigate the adsorption of ionic and anionic surfac-tants with various carbonate materials including natural and synthetic carbonate.
