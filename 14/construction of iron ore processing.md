 · Introduction. A blast furnace is a special type of cylindrical furnace which is basically used for the purpose of smelting. So the industrial metals can be extracted from their ores like iron pig iron or copper. The word 'blast' gives the idea of combustion air which is forcefully supplied or produced to the atmospheric pressure above.

 · Magnetized drums collect magnetic material so it can be further concentrated (magnetite iron minerals content). The lighter particles that were separated during the spiral gravity separation step are rolled into balls (combined with bentonite or a similar binding agent) and cooked in an induction oven. This process is known as pelletization.

At the surface iron ore processing plants the iron ore is put through crushers and ball mills to break it into a uniform and more workable size and then washed with the residue going to tailings. The ore is the transported to the various smelters loed locally or on the other side of the world with large bulk carriers being used to ship the ore by sea.

The first metallurgical step involved in this process is to reduce iron ore to metallic iron in a blast furnace using coke as both a fuel and reducing agent. The produced metallic iron contains a relatively high proportion of carbon (4%) and it is passed to the steelmaking process in the form of liquid at approximately 1450 C called as 'hot metal'.

Further reduction of the iron ore is undertaken directly by the coke in the upper areas of the furnace. Non-iron bearing materials in the furnace form a slag which is molten at the high temperatures inside. The molten iron and molten slag produced in the furnace both fall to the hearth where they are periodically "tapped" through a taphole.
