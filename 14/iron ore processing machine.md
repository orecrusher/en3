Iron makes up close to 5% of the Earth's crust. It takes around 1.6 tons of iron ore to produce one ton of steel. The chemical symbol for iron is 'Fe' because of its Latin name Ferrum. We use 20 times more iron (in the form of steel) than all other metals put together. Our iron ore trains are over 2.5km (264 ore cars) long meaning it can take

## Iron Ore Mining 
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
