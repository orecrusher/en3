## Rapid determination of soil unconfined compressive 
 · Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) is one of the most important mechanical properties for evaluating the strength of adhesive soils in many engineering projects including forest roads. Measuring the USC of soil in the laboratory and in situ is difficult time-consuming and costly so it is essential to explore a rapid low-cost and non-destructive method.

A jaw crusher breaks minerals ores of high strength. The stiffness of swing jaw plate has not been varied with changes in rock strength. Thus stiffness of swing plate is enough to crush taconite with an unconfined compressive strength (Q U ) of up to 308 MPa may be over signed for softer fragmental. Hence the weight of the swing plate is necessary to reduced.

 · Another method to calculate the crushing force and accordingly the bearing force for single particle comminution is the use of the material compressive strength. Since the PLT-index I S(50) generated with the point load test (PLT) shows a good correlation to the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) this value is often used to describe the material strength.
