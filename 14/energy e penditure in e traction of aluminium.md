Extraction of Metals. Extraction of Aluminium - Electrolysis Cell.. The steel container is coated with carbon and this is used as the negative electrode ().. Aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3) is an ionic compound. When it is melted the Al 3+ and O 2-ions are free to move and conduct electricity. Electrolysis of the alumina/cryolite solution gives aluminium at the hode and oxygen at the anode.

Extraction of Metals. Aluminium - Cost and Recycling.. Aluminium is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust after oxygen and silicon. It is the most abundant metal but it is more expensive to produce than iron because of the cost of the large amounts of electricity which are needed for electrolysis - see moles. About half of the aluminium used in the UK is recycled.

## Electrolytic Extraction of Aluminium from Bauxite and 
 · In examining the electrolytic extraction of aluminium from bauxite and alumina we must first briefly explain the element called aluminium and the minerals and ores that contain this very important metallic element. Aluminum is the third most plentiful element in the earth's crust being found abundantly as trioxosilies(IV) in rocks and clays.

## Mining and Refining – Energy Efficiency 
Aluminium is an "energy bank"; most of the original input can be recovered every time the product is recycled. Bauxite mining requires relatively low energy inputs compared to other steps in the aluminium production process – with less than 1.5 kilograms of fuel oil (mainly in the form of diesel for haul trucks) and less than 5 kWh of electricity consumed per tonne of bauxite extracted.
