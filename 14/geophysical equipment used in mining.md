## Resistivity and Induced Polarisation Surveys 
 · An induced polarisation survey is usually run at the same time as a resistivity survey. The resistivity method can be adapted to an induced polarisation method with the addition of switches and changes to the instrumentation. One of the main advantages of doing the two types of surveys together is to save time as well as associated costs.
