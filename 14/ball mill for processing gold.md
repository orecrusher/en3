## Ball Mill: Operating principles components Uses 
 · A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 – 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

If the cyclone underflow gold grade was higher than the cyclone overflow grade then you have free gold and you should look at putting a centrifugal concentrator in the grinding circuit. For low tonnage operations you can feed 100% of the ball mill discharge to the concentrator (this requires an extra pump but is worth the effort).
