 · Speed S is simply a change in distance over a change in time. Miles per hour or mph in North America is the most common unit. The equation looks like this: S = d/t. To find tip speed we need the rotor diameter and rotational rate. So assume a rotor diameter of 100m and a rotation rate (ω) of 15 revolutions/min rpm.

Figure 4. A car moving at a velocity v to the right has a tire rotating with an angular velocity ω.The speed of the tread of the tire relative to the axle is v the same as if the car were jacked up.Thus the car moves forward at linear velocity v = rω where r is the tire radius. A larger angular velocity for the tire means a greater velocity for the car.
