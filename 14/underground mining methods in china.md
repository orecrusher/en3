 · Most mining operations combine different methods to extract minerals most efficiently. Initially the mineral closer to the surface would be mined using a surface mining method. After the minerals have been exhausted that way the coal found deeper in the seam would be mined using an underground mining method.

## Green Mining 
In situ mining (see mining solution page) can be more environmentally friendly than underground mining and is cheaper than many mining methods (Ulmer-Scholle 2008). However in situ mining cannot be implemented in all cases as the ore needs to be beneath the water table (the level at which the ground is saturated with water) and it needs to be porous enough to let the leaching solution
