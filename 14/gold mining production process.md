## Extracting Gold 
To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

Theoretically it's possible to form gold by the nuclear processes of fusion fission and radioactive decay. It's easiest for scientists to transmute gold by bombarding the heavier element mercury and producing gold via decay.
