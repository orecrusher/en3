Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are a central part of the production route that is an alternative to the dominant BF-BOF route. EAFs are used to produce carbon steels and alloy steels primarily by recycling ferrous scrap. In an EAF scrap and/or manufactured iron units – such as DRI pig iron iron carbide – is melted and converted into high quality steel by using high-power electric arcs

After other important steps are completed the steel now cooled somewhat goes through a thin-slab caster a tunnel furnace and the seven-stand hot mill where it's reduced in thickness to match customer orders. The steel may then undergo further value-added finishing processes if requested by the customer.
