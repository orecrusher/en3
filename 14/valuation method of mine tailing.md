"Net asset value" is the net present value (NPV) or discounted cash flow (DCF) value of all the future cash flow. Cash Flow Cash Flow (CF) is the increase or decrease in the amount of money a business institution or individual has.

## What are alternative uses for tailings? 
 · By utilising tailings as a material with value as opposed to waste customers are able to extract 'treasure from trash' reducing the need for a whole new mine site to mine those minerals. In the face of new challenges and a changing mining landscape the collapse of tailings dams demonstrates that safety cannot be compromised and new technology must be considered.

Mine Tailings. Mine tailings' size and composition depends on the mining method. For hardrock metal mines tailings are usually a very fine mud or powder which is left over after ore is crushed and valuable minerals are extracted from it. Tailings may also contain chemicals used for mineral extraction.

 · As mine tailings would not necessarily represent a premium quality standard aggregate. A stabilization method to enhance their mechanical properties was used. Previous research study (Saghafi and Katayama 2013 ) has shown that stabilization of quarry waste dust has successfully improved its mechanical properties for use in pavement base and subbase layers.

 · Such methods include the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) Travel Cost Method (TCM) and Hedonic Pricing Method (HPM). For example Burton et al. (2012) used the choice modeling method in their study and this required 252 respondents to assess the environmental valuation of a bauxite mine site in Western Australia.

The tailings dumps were hydraulically mined reprocessed and stored in an engineered impoundment loed 10km south east of Kalgoorlie. From the 60 million tonnes of tailings mined 695000 ounces of gold was recovered by Carbon-in-Circuit (CIC) and Carbon-in-Pulp (CIP) leach and absorption circuits (Kaltails 1998; Normandy 1998).

## Mine tailings: How to effectively manage the risk
 · While the tailings risk is unlikely to affect the actual mining effort; a collapsed tailings dam can destroy the mine's value as well as a company's reputation and licence to operate. Rather than look at tailings in isolation it actually makes more sense to include it as part of water management.
