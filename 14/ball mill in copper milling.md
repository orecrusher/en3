 · The Magma Copper initial ball charge is 50 pct 1.5-in-diam carbon steel balls and 50 pct 2.0-in-diam balls. The total grinding ball wear rate is 1.13 lb/st of dry ore and mill throughput is 85 st/h. This is equivalent to a linear penetration rate of about 2600 mpy; therefore corrosion is directly responsible for about 1 pct of the total grinding media wear at Magma Copper Co.
