 · Where Does Metal Ore Come From? Most metals that we use come from metal ores found in the earth's crust. Metal ores are made up of different compounds. Bauxite for example contains about 99 percent aluminum and magnetite about 72 percent iron. These metal ore deposits that contain large percentages of a single element are the easiest to extract.

Millers the men who ran the mills were also multi-talented. They often owned the mill site as well as the mill. They had to have a good knowledge of the trade itself and be able to maintain the equipment once it was constructed and put in place. Millers' fees were not small. Usually they asked one quarter of the lumber sawn or grain ground.

## How are metals more reactive than carbon extracted?
The reactivity of a metal determines how it is extracted. Metals above carbon in the reactivity series must be extracted using electrolysis. Metals less reactive than carbon can be extracted from their ores by reduction. Copper silver gold and platinum can occur as native metals and do not need to be extracted.

## How much metal does the ore contain? « World Ocean Review
Copper ore does not contain pure copper but either a copper-sulphur-iron compound (chalcopyrite) or a copper-sulphur compound (chalcocite). The metal must first be separated from such minerals by means of multi-step metallurgic processes. In many cases these processes are so complied that they account for up to 30 per cent of the metal price.

## How Metals are Made 
 · Iron ore is smelted in a blast furnace: Superheated air—up to 2200°F—is "blasted" into the furnace causing it to burn much hotter than it otherwise could. A typical blast furnace at a steel mill runs for 24 hours a day 365 days a weeks for up to 20 years before it must be replaced. Pure steel is very susceptible to rust.
