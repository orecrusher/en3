## Cone Crushers 
 · Cone Crushers: Moreover there is a crushing chamber in between the fixed and the moveable cone. When the minerals or the rock enter the cone crusher from the top it halts the top portion and gets squeezed between the mantle and the bowl liner. When the large pieces are broken they can move to the lower area to get destroyed again.
