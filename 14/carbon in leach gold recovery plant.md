Highlights Worldwide gold recovery on activated carbon grew from zero to almost 70% in twenty years from 1980. The stellar attributes of carbon gold plants led to complacency in the industry in designing and operating these plants. Most CIP and CIL plants are overdesigned and operated sub-optimally. Optimum design criteria and operating conditions are easily determined with simple test work

## GOLD RECOVERY FROM CARBON 
1. A method for recovering gold from carbon fines in a resin-in-leach process wherein the fines are contacted with an ion exchange resin in the presence of a suitable lixiviant whereby gold is loaded onto the resin and the gold-loaded resin is then eluted using a suitable eluent whereafter gold is recovered from a resulting eluate.

Activated carbon is widely used for gold recovery from cyanide leach liquors via carbon-in-leach (CIL) or carbon-in-pulp (CIP) technology. From all the base metals cyanide complexes typically present together with gold in the leach liquor only copper and to a lesser extent nickel are loaded onto activated carbon(6).

Carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp are continuous processes that use activated carbon in a cascade of large agitated tanks which have been widely used to recover or concentrate precious metals in gold extraction plants. In the carbon-in-pulp process adsorption occurs after the leaching cascade section of the plant and in the carbon-in-leach process leaching and adsorption occur simultaneously.

Focussing on the gold industry Gekko replace high-energy whole ore treatment of gold by carbon-in-leach (CIL) methodologies with beneficial low-energy process solutions. Harnessing both gravity separation and floatation as well as dramatically reducing the initial mass to be processed by pre-concentration Gekko flowsheets increase the grade for downstream intensive processing.
