## Primary cementing placement design 
 · Stage-cementing tools or differential valve (DV) tools are used to cement multiple sections behind the same casing string or to cement a critical long section in multistages. Stage cementing may reduce mud contamination and lessens the possibility of high filtrate loss or formation breakdown caused by high hydrostatic pressures which is often a cause for lost circulation.
