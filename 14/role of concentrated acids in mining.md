 · Concentrated sulfuric acid is often used as a alyst in Fischer esterifiion reactions. To my knowledge the role it plays in the reaction is not as a reducing agent or dehydrating agent but only serves the role of creating an acidic environment as seen in the mechanism. Thus dilute sulfuric acid would be sufficient.
