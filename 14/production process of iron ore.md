## Electrolysis of Iron Ores: Most Efficient Technologies for 
 · Abstract. Electrolysis of iron ore has not been developed in the past because of the energetic balance and energy expenses. In addition until now its appliion in iron production has been hindered due to the difficulty in finding a suitable anode material capable of weathering the challenging conditions.

## DRI production 
DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state i.e. without melting as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen coming from reformed natural gas syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

## An Overview of Steelmaking Process Global Market Size 
The first metallurgical step involved in this process is to reduce iron ore to metallic iron in a blast furnace using coke as both a fuel and reducing agent. The produced metallic iron contains a relatively high proportion of carbon (4%) and it is passed to the steelmaking process in the form of liquid at approximately 1450 C called as 'hot metal'.

In the DRI process iron ore in the form of lump or pellets is reduced to metallic iron in the solid state unlike in the BF where the material is melted. Today about 100 Mt of DRI is produced globally each year with the majority of that using reformed natural gas (essentially splitting natural gas into hydrogen and carbon monoxide) to strip away the oxygen from the iron ore.
