## Attribute Subset Selection in Data Mining 
 · Attribute subset Selection is a technique which is used for data reduction in data mining process. Data reduction reduces the size of data so that it can be used for analysis purposes more efficiently. The data set may have a large number of attributes. But some of those attributes can be irrelevant or redundant.

 · Feature Selection. After you've generated new features you might want to tidy up some of your data. Perhaps you calculated a rate of change and you want to remove the Attributes you used to create the calculation and only keep the new Feature/Attribute. Sometimes you might want to remove correlated Attributes or randomly select Attributes.
