## What are the essential components of belt conveyor system 
While all conveyor systems contain these parts designs vary in the construction materials and where each component is loed. Belt support is the component that ensures the belt moves smoothly. If the support unit is not firm the belt sags when workers place a heavy object on top and the sagging causes the belt not to move smoothly or swiftly as it should.
