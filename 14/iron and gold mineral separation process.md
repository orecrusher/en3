The best answer as to how to recover that gold depends on the amount of pyrite you intend to process. If you have only a few pounds it can be roasted by heat in the open air and then mixed with a flux like sodium borate and melted with a collector metal like copper. The melt can be poured into a mold and the gold will now be alloyed in the copper.

## Particle Analysis in Mining and Minerals 
In many cases the valuable minerals are mixed with gangue commercially useless material and the ore must be separated. The first step of many separation processes is comminution (size reduction) followed by classifiion (separation by particle size) either for further grinding or the next step concentration of the ore.

 · This process is called eddy current separation. Although aluminum is not magnetic this technology can levitate it and allow plastics to drop out of the process. Recovering precious metals such as palladium platinum gold and other valuable metals such as copper lead and silver from electronic waste becomes economically viable only if enough scrap is collected.
