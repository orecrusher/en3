Basically the taconite process involves crushing the rock to a fine-grain size then mechanically removing the iron minerals from the waste material. Magnetite can be removed from the siliceous waste materials by large electromagnets. Hematite requires a more sophistied process for concentration.

## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes 
 · Bonding of mineral grains developed during induration of pellets is affected by the three factors consisting of (i) solid oxide bonding (ii) re-crystallization of iron oxide and (iii) slag bonding. Solid oxide bonding is due to the oxidation of ferrous iron oxides to ferric iron oxides which results in bonding and bridging but only by a limited amount.

Grain size has a measurable effect on most mechanical properties. For exam-ple at room temperature hardness yield strength tensile strength fatigue strength and impact strength all increase with decreasing grain size. Machinability is also affected; rough machining favors coarse grain size while finish machining favors fine grain size.

The iron content magnetite is only 20- 30% compared to 50 - 60 % iron content in red ore. Red ore is also referred to as direct shipped ore because it can be shipped without processing.
