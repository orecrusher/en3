## A Review of the Comprehensive Recovery of Valuable 
 · Copper smelting open-circuit (CSO) dust contains various valuable metals such as copper lead and zinc as well as undesirable toxic elements such as arsenic. Thus the comprehensive recovery of valuable elements from CSO dust is highly significant from both economic and environmental perspectives. In this review pyrometallurgical pyrohydrometallurgical and

Copper dust emanating from the Sarcheshmeh furnaces was a suitable substrate for bioleaching process and as chalcocite was the main copper mineral mesophilic bacteria degraded it easily. Increasing the pulp density created a condition with higher toxicity and shear stress and decreased the mass transfer all of that resulted in slowing down the process rate and copper recovery.

## Recover Copper in Smelter Dust
 · The copper in cyclone and cottrell dust ranges widely (from 15 to 30 wt- pct) and accounts for 3 to 10 pct of the copper fed to the primary melting furnace. With improved dust recovery systems only about 0.5 pct of the copper charged to the smelter is lost by dust entrainment in the smelter gas and 1 to 2 pct is lost in the waste slags.
