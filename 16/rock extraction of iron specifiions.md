To use rock in engineering appliions certain prop-erties of the rock must be assessed to reasonably pre-dict performance in the as-built condition. The proper-ties of rock fall into two broad classes: rock material properties relating to the rock itself and rock mass properties relating to the in-place rock mass including its discontinuities.

There are different types of chemical weathering the most important are: Solution - removal of rock in solution by acidic rainwater. In particular limestone is weathered by rainwater containing dissolved CO2 (this process is sometimes called carbonation). Hydrolysis - the breakdown of rock by acidic water to produce clay and soluble salts.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? 
 · Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however because iron does not occur naturally it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.
