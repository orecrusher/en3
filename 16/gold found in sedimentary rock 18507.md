## Sedimentary Mineral Deposits 
 · The gold veins of Northern Ontario are found closely associated with intrusions of granite rock. The great sedimentary deposits of low-grade siliceous iron ores found in the Lake Superior region and in other parts of Ontario were laid down in preCambrian time.

## NATURE OF GOLD MINERALISATION IN THE WALHALLA 
Altered and bleached metasedimentary rocks exhibit an increase in SiO2 and CO2 and decrease in Al2O3 Fe2O3 and K2O. The highest gold and sulphur values are found within the dyke. Arsenopyrite is commonly a good indior for gold mineralisation although at Cohen's Reef elevated gold values do not correspond with presence of arsenopyrite.

## The giant Kalgoorlie Gold Field revisited 
 · Gold mineralization is hosted in all rock types within the Gold Field but the Golden Mile Dolerite is the principal host to ore. The distribution and style of gold mineralization and lode geometry in all deposits is controlled by a complex interplay of structural development rheological and chemical contrasts in host rocks and dyke intrusion (e.g. Nixon et al. 2014 ).

 · Copper is found alongside many other types of ore. It can be found near gold silver zinc lead and other types of metal deposits. When mixed in with other ores copper is not usually found in great abundance. Until the development of the modern copper mining process it was typically a byproduct of mining for other metals.

## Where Is Gold Found in Nature? 
 · Dan/CC-BY-2.0. Gold is found throughout the earth and the sea. There are natural spots on the earth that contain more amounts of gold. Gold is commonly found within rock and granite in the earth. In its natural form gold is very irregular and not refined as it is normally seen in its finished state. Gold is found in many forms.

Such quartz crystals are only found in certain sedimentary rocks like limestones and gypsum deposits in which they form at relatively low temperatures often during diagenesis. Authigenic quartz can occur as clusters of crystals sometimes with a bizarre look or as single double-terminated crystals or as a combination of both.

## Geology: Gold Artifacts Found In Coal Mines
 · In the past few centuries gold artifacts have reportedly been found in coal mines.. Gold artifacts have reportedly been found in coal mines. The artifacts called out-of-place artifacts (OOPArts) are items such as gold that can be dated to a certain era but are found in formations that scientists claim are millions of years old.

 · Gneiss schist lithium clay sand gravel and building stone can be found throughout the piedmont and gold was once mined there in abundance. The region's hard rock meets the soft sediment of its eastern neighbor at an area known as the "fall line" or "fall zone" which is the site of many rapids and waterfalls.

## Description of Minerals and Rocks 
Rocks because they are mixtures of minerals are more complex and are classified according to how they formed. The broadest grouping of rocks is based on the origin of the rock rather than on the minerals that compose it. In this scheme all rocks are divided into three general groups: igneous sedimentary and metamorphic rocks (figure 6).
