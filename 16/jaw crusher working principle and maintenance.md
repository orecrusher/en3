## How does a Single Toggle Jaw Crusher work? 
Typically jaw crushers produce less fine material than impact crushers. The reduction ratio of a jaw is approx. 4 to 1. Fines are necessary to meet certain gradations and increase material compaction. This is the reason why a jaw crusher is predominenatly used as a primary crusher for an intial reduction in size or to produce a non-spec material.

## What is a Jaw Crusher 
The working principle of jaw crushers: When working the motor drives the belt and pulley to move the movable jaw up and down through the eccentric shaft. When the movable jaw rises the angle between the toggle plate and the movable jaw becomes larger thereby pushing the movable jaw plate closer to the fixed jaw plate and the material passes through the two jaws.
