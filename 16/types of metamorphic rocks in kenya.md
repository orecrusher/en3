## 11.3: Metamorphic Rock Names 
 · Foliated Metamorphic Rocks. As mentioned previously differential pressures can cause a foliation to develop in metamorphosed rocks. There are a few types of foliations that are commonly seen in metamorphic rocks each foliation type is dependent on the minerals that define the foliation.

## Types Of Metamorphic Rocks 
The most common foliated types of metamorphic rocks are: gneiss slate and schist. More specifically abundant quartz and feldspar minerals contained in granular mineral grains make up gneiss and justify its banded appearance. Slate on the other hand is a metamorphic rock that is created when shale goes through a deep process of metamorphism.
