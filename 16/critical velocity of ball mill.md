 · Critical rotation speed of dry ball-mill was studied by experiments and by numerical simulation using Discrete Element Method (DEM). The results carried out by both methods showed good agreement. It has been commonly accepted that the critical rotation speed is a function of a ball radius and a jar diameter.

Ball mills are normally operated at around 75% of critical speed so a mill with diameter 5 metres will turn at around 14 rpm. The mill is usually divided into at least two chambers (although this depends upon feed input size - mills including a roller press are mostly single-chambered) allowing the use of different sizes of grinding media.
