In order for surface mining to be economically feasible the ratio of waste material (or overburden) to oil sands ore must be relatively low. As the oil sands deposit gets deeper below grade more and more overburden must be removed before the valuable oil sands. Most mined oil sands deposits are loed within 50 meters from the surface.

Cyanide is mainly produced for the mining of gold and silver: It helps dissolve these metals allowing separation from the other soids. In the cyanide process finely ground high-grade ore is mixed with the cyanide (at a ratio of about 1:500 parts NaCN to ore); low-grade ores are stacked into heaps and sprayed with a cyanide solution (at a ratio of about 1:1000 parts NaCN to ore).
