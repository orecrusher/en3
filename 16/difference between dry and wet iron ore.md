Dry Metric Tonne Unit. A Dry Metric Tonne (Ton) Unit (dmtu) is the internationally agreed-upon unit of measure for iron ore pricing. It has the same mass value as a metric tonne but the material has been dried to decrease the moisture level. A dry metric ton unit consists of 1% of iron (Fe) contained in a tonne of ore excluding moisture.

## Wet and Dry Corrosion 
Dry corrosion occurs when there is no water or moisture to aid the corrosion and the metal oxidises with the atmosphere alone. Wet corrosion of metals occurs through electron transfer involving two processes oxidation and reduction. In oxidation the metal atoms lose electrons. The surrounding environment then gains the electrons in reduction.
