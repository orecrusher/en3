Screening usually follows after comminution. The aim of this experiment was to screen and sieve haematite ore and to study its particle size distribution. The screening was done using an industrial screen and the sieving was done using laboratory Tyler sieves. The initial mass of the ore manually fed to the screen was 11.965 kg.

Iron makes up close to 5% of the Earth's crust. It takes around 1.6 tons of iron ore to produce one ton of steel. The chemical symbol for iron is 'Fe' because of its Latin name Ferrum. We use 20 times more iron (in the form of steel) than all other metals put together. Our iron ore trains are over 2.5km (264 ore cars) long meaning it can take
