Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silie carbonate or sulphate ores.

Copper Appliions in Metallurgy of Copper Copper Alloys. Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels called adits to reach the ore.

 · Copper processing the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products.. In its pure form or as an alloy copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

## How is copper mined and processed? 
Mined from open pits copper ore must be crushed as part of the process that occurs between extraction and production. After the ore is crushed it's roasted which helps to convert sulfides to oxides. The oxides are smelted to produce matte which then undergoes several refining processes.
