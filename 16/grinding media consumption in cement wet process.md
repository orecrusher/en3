## Grinding 
The ball mill rolls grinding media together with the ore as the ore grinds these balls initially 5-10 cm in diameter but gradually wear out. Grinding is always carried out under wet conditions with about 70% solid mixture in water. This procedure maximizes ore production and minimizes power consumption.
