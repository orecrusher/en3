## Iron ore grindability improvement by microwave pre 
 · Ore grinding is a cost- and energy-intensive process in which the wear of balls is a significant practical problem leading to a substantial increase in the production cost. With the present trend towards utilization of low grade ores requiring finer grind for liberation the amount of media wear per tonne of concentrate recovered is steadily on the increase [16] .

Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing grinding magnetic separation flotation and gravity separation etc. iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.

## Research of iron ore grinding in a vertical
The total energy consumption for ore comminution will further increase within the next decades. One contribution to minimise the increase is to use more efficient comminution equipment. Vertical-roller-mills (VRM) are an energy-efficient alternative to conventional grinding technology. One reason is the dry in-bed grinding principle.

## Reducing Grinding Energy and Cost 
Reducing Grinding Energy and Cost - Magnetite Iron Ore Design Case Study Efficiency of the comminution operations is traditionally assessed based on operating cost and energy consumption. Traditionally the lowest operating cost was achieved by multi-stage fully autogenous grinding due to elimination of steel grinding media costs which may represent up to 50% of the grinding cost.
