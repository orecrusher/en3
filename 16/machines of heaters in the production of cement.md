 · Though "cement" and "concrete" are often used interchangeably concrete is actually the final product made from cement. The primary component of cement is limestone. To produce cement limestone and other clay-like materials are heated in a kiln at 1400°C and then ground to form a lumpy solid substance called clinker; clinker is then combined with gypsum to form cement.
