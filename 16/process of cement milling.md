## Modelling and simulation of raw material blending process 
A successful attempt is made to simulate the mill operation by including the main components of the process concerning mixing and dynamics. The simulator calculates the chemical analyses and modules of raw meal in the mill outlet and also the dynamics of the main module characterizing raw meal and cement i.e. the lime saturation factor (LSF).

As part of the grinding process calcium sulfate is added as a set regulator usually in the form of gypsum (CaSO 4.2H 2 O). Natural anhydrite (CaSO 4) may also be added. Cooling is necessary to limit the temperature rise of the cement. This is done by a mixture of both air-cooling and water-cooling including spraying water inside the mill.
