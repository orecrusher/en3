## Water In Oil Contamination 
 · The Effects of Water Contamination. In a lubriing system the two most harmful phases are free and emulsified water. In journal bearings for example the incompressibility of water relative to oil can result in a loss of the hydrodynamic oil film that in turn leads to excessive wear. As little as one percent water in oil can reduce the life expectancy of a journal bearing by as much as 90

## Lubricant Chemistry and Oil/Water Separator Performance 
Water can be exhibited in three phases within the oil system. When water encounters a lubricant the chemistry of the lubricant dictates the amount of water that can be naturally dissolved known as the saturation point. Beyond this saturation point water may then emulsify within the fluid in which the water and lubricant remain mixed together.

## Bearing Lube System Reconfiguration for Safety Related 
This white paper examines a system reconfiguration to eliminate a problematic solenoid valve from a bearing lubriion system for an essential service water (ESW) pump. Elimination of the solenoid valve solved procurement issues (the valve could not be purchased from a 10CFR50 Appendix B supplier) as well as valve clogging issues which had resulted in reduced service intervals for the end-user.

The lubriion system used for aero-derivative type gas turbines is different from that in an industrial gas turbine in that a scavenge (vacuum) system is added in the latter to return lube oil to the sump under flight conditions.

## Do Water
Water pump lubricant manufacturers claim that their products not only lubrie the water pump seal but they also prevent rust and corrosion. Sounds like a great solution doesn't it? However there's one problem: modern water pumps are self-lubriing so it's pretty pointless to add water pump lubriion additives to your cooling system.
