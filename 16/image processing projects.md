## What is Image Processing? (with pictures)
Image processing is a physical process used to convert an image signal either digital or analog into a physical image. The actual output itself can be an actual physical image or the characteristics of an image. The most common type is photography in which an image is captured using a camera to create a digital or analog image.

## 1. Introduction to image processing 
Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it. It is a type of signal processing in which input is an image and output may be image or characteristics/features associated with that image. Nowadays image processing is among rapidly growing technologies.
