## Metal Rolling 
At a rolling mill blooms and slabs are further rolled down to intermediate parts such as plate sheet strip coil billets bars and rods. Many of these products will be the starting material for subsequent manufacturing operations such as forging sheet metal working wire drawing extrusion and machining.
