## SAMPLING METHOD 
When sampling in sub-bases field sieve analyses of material larger than 20 mm were performed to a great extent. Certain preparatory experiments were performed with the aid of image analysis (photographs from field of compacted material). Finally a proposal concerning "A method for sampling roadbase and sub-base layers" is described. (A)

## Components Of Road Pavement Structure 
Sub-base. 3. Base course. 4. Surface course or wearing course. All these components belong to a typical flexible pavement whereas rigid pavement usually consists of subgrade subbase and a concrete slab. 1. Subgrade: The finished and compacted surface of earthwork on which a road pavement rests is called subgrade or formation.

## Base course 
The base course or basecourse in pavements is a layer of material in an asphalt roadway race track riding arena or sporting field.It is loed under the surface layer consisting of the wearing course and sometimes an extra binder course.. If there is a sub-base course the base course is constructed directly above this layer.

(b) Inadequate wearing course: If the wearing course is of inadequate thickness or if it is totally absent the sub-base or base courses are exposed to the damaging effects of the climatic agencies and the traffic. (c) Lack of lateral confinement: If lateral confinement is not provided for granular sub-base or base courses the action of traffic causes the materials of these courses to spread out.

## If there is a delay of bituminous laying on top of sub 
If there is a delay of bituminous laying on top of sub-base should tack coat be applied on the top surface of sub-base? When there is a delay between bituminous laying of different bituminous layers (i.e. roadbase base course etc.) a tack coat is applied on top of the bituminous layers because it helps to enhance better bonding between bituminous materials.

Asphalt stabilization results in more flexibility compared to other base course materials and chemical stabilizers and can be used alongside other additives. Reclaimer/stabilizers can be used both as a recycler to pulverize asphalt surfaces and base layers and mix in new binders but also as a soil stabilizer to mix in lime cement and other stabilizing additives.

 · The 3 common causes of failure of flexible pavement are as follow. Failure of subgrade. Failure of sub-base or base course. Failure of surface or wearing course. 1. Failure of Subgrade. This is the main cause of flexible pavement failure. When there is excessive deformation in subgrade soil it will result in failure of whole pavement.
