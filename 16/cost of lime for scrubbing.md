CO 2 ­ ­scrubbing is a particular form of carbon capture that takes place after fossil fuel has been combusted but before the exhaust is released into the air. ­Aside from its currently hefty price tag many people see CO 2 ­ scrubbing as one of the easiest ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions since it doesn't require any lifestyle changes.

## The Kraft Recovery Process 
NCG incineration. If wet scrubbers are used for capturing lime dust some SO2 recovery will also occur there. The emission of SO2 from bark and power boilers depends on the sulphur content of the fuel used and on the efficiency of any wet scrubbers that might be employed. SO2 emissions from NCG incinerators depend on scrubber efficiency.

## Amine Scrubbing for CO2 Capture 
 · Amine scrubbing has been used to separate carbon dioxide (CO2) from natural gas and hydrogen since 1930. It is a robust technology and is ready to be tested and used on a larger scale for CO2 capture from coal-fired power plants. The minimum work requirement to separate CO2 from coal-fired flue gas and compress CO2 to 150 bar is 0.11 megawatt-hours per metric ton of CO2.
