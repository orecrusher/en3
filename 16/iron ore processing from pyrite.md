## The metamorphism of pyrite and pyritic ores: an overview 
Pyrite the most widespread and abundant of sulphide minerals in the Earth's surficial rocks commonly constitutes the primary opaque phase in ore deposits. Consequently an understanding of the behaviour of pyrite and its relationships with coexisting phases during the metamorphism of pyritebearing rocks is vital to the interpretation of their genesis and post-depositional history.
