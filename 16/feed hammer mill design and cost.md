Here we provide a hammer grinding machine – fish feed hammer mill for processing feed stuffs of various granularity into small pieces. And here is the working principle of this machine: hammer hit breaks raw materials in the crushing chamber with high-speed rotation; then the broken materials move with continuous friction and crash against the hammer toothed plate and sieve for crushing.

 · Hammer mills consist of a series of hammers suspended from a central shaft and enclosed within a rigid metal casing. Particle size reduction in a hammer mill occurs as a result of the impaction/attrition between the rapidly moving hammers and relatively slow-moving particles (Koch 2002; Van der Poel et al. 2018).
