## Designing a dust collector for your pneumatic conveying system
In a pneumatic conveying system a dust collector is loed at the system's terminal point and separates material from the conveying gas [typically air]. The material drops into a receiver bin and dust is captured in the dust collector's filter elements. [Editor's note: While this article concentrates on applying baghouse dust collectors

## Introduction to Pneumatic Conveying of Solids
What is pneumatic conveying? Pneumatic conveying is the movement of solids through pipe using gas (usually air) as the motive force. It differs from hydraulic or slurry conveying in that the gas expands continuously along the pipe length. The flow regime in the pipe depends greatly on the ratio of solids to gas and the particle characteristics.

Such oversights can often lead to problems that end up costing end users much more than just system capital costs.
