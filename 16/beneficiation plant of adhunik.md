## Reasons For Bauxite Beneficiation 
Adopting the process of washing bauxite in the beneficiation plant can reduce caustic soda consumption and equipment and piping scale in the alumina refinery (OPEX) and consequently the payback for the beneficiation plant can be less than 3 (three) years. Besides the caustic consumption reduction the beneficiation plant decreases the refinery

For rare resources beneficiation is critical because it takes advantage of every scrap of material available. This practice can also make a marginal mining facility more practical than it might otherwise be and may in fact be used to extract ore from a facility previously believed to be exhausted.
