material is compressed between the platens of a testing machine as illustrated in Fig. 8.1. The compressive strength is then defined as the maximum load applied to crush the specimen divided by the cross-sectional area. Rock strength has been found to be size dependent because of the cracks and fissures that are often present in the material.
