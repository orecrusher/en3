## Climb Milling Vs Conventional Milling 
 · Climb Milling Vs Conventional Milling. Updated: Jun 7 2020. Conventional Milling: when the cutter is rotating in clock wise direction and work piece is fed from left to right is called conventional milling; meaning it looks like it is trying to pull the material out of the work piece.

## Any benefit to climb vs. regular milling?
 · In climb milling the tooth enters the material at full feed per tooth there is no sliding and the chip gradually thins out until it breaks off. On metals that work harden the material gets hardened by the sliding in conventional milling but not with climb. So your tool lasts longer.

conventional milling starts out with zero chip thickness and increases climb is the other way around. basically when conventional milling the cutter is pushed away from the work until the force exceeds the tensile strength of the metal you're cutting and then it digs in. the radius of the cutting edge and the length of cut sets the force needed. it may be.. incredible.

## Still Confused with Conventional and Climb Milling 
 · I don't believe that the terms climb and conventional apply to a lathe. The cutter on a lathe is stationary so the only way to feed is to rotate the worki into the cutting edge. Rotating in the opposite direction would create a drag situation. As to when to use climb vs. conventional milling

 · The up milling is also called as conventional milling or Climb up milling in which the cutter and feed moves in opposite direction i.e the rotary cutter moves against the feed.. With reference to the adjacent figure you can see that the cutter rotates in anti-clockwise direction while the direction of feed is from right to left.

Climb and conventional Climb Conventional There are two methods for the milling operation - climb milling and conventional milling. For many years it was common practice to mill against the direction of the feed due to the absence of backlash eliminating devices and the use of high speed steel cutters. This method is called conventional milling.
