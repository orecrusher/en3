## Hydrometallurgy Gold Extraction 
Hydrometallurgy originated in the 16th century but its principal development took place in the 20th century stimulated partly by the desire to extract gold from low-grade ores. The development of ion exchange solvent extraction and other processes has led to an extremely broad range of appliions of hydrometallurgy now used to produce more than 70 metallic elements.
