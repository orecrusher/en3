In sulfide roasting if the temperature and gas conditions are such that the sulfide feed is completely oxidized the process is known as "dead roasting." Sometimes as in the case of pre-treating reverberatory or electric smelting furnace feed the roasting process is performed with less than the required amount of oxygen to fully oxidize the feed.

## Smelting 
Roasting the carbonate and sulfide minerals in air converts them to oxides. The oxides in turn are smelted into the metal. Carbon monoxide was (and is) the reducing agent of choice for smelting. It is easily produced during the heating process and as a gas comes into intimate contact with the ore.
