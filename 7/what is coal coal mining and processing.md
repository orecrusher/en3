## What is coal where is it found? 
The area will only ever become a mine if it is large enough and of sufficient quality that the coal can be economically recovered. Once this has been confirmed mining operations begin. As coal reserves are found across the globe the largest coal producing regions are not confined to one region – the top five hard coal producers are China India USA Indonesia and Australia.

NZ Coal Carbon Birchfield Coal Mines and BT Mining are the major producers. Fonterra dairy co-operative is among mine owners producing coal to power some of its processing operations. Some New Zealand coal has highly sought-after properties such as low-sulphur and ash content and superior "swelling" properties for use in blast furnaces.

The coal is transported to the processing plant where impurities are removed. Coal that is deeper than a few hundred metres under the surface must be extracted using too underground mining methods. Some coal is mined by the Bord and Pillar method. This is where a machine continually cuts into the coal.

## Learn About Wyoming Coal Mining.
Mining Processing. Coal in Wyoming is uncovered and removed by large machines in a process called surface mining. Before the coal can be removed from the ground the topsoil and dirt above it is removed using scrapers. This soil is usually removed ahead of the pit and carried behind to place on top of reclaimed areas or backfill.

## Coal Geology 
Mining. Coal is mined by both surface or 'opencut' (or opencast) and underground or 'deep' mining methods depending on the local geology of the deposit. Underground mining currently accounts for about 60 per cent of world coal production but around 80 per cent of Australia's coal is produced from opencut mines.

Miners face great physical risk due to accidents explosions and mine collapses. In China roughly workers die from underground mining accidents each year. Miners are also directly exposed to toxic fumes coal dust and toxic metals increasing their risk for fatal lung diseases such as pneumoconiosis and silicosis.

## How is coal mined and extracted? 
Conveyors or cars (railway wagons) transport the coal to vertical shafts for removal from the mine. After the coal is brought up to the surface by conveyors it undergoes a process that removes sand and mud by immersing the coal in a solution of water and tiny magnetite particles. The different elements separate naturally.

Coal washing is an indispensable process for deep processing of coal. Coal preparation plant also named coal wash plant. The coal directly mined from the mine is called raw coal. The raw coal is mixed with many impurities during the mining process and the quality of the coal is different.
