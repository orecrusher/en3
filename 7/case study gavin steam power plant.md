The steam from plant #3 is used to drive a turbine powered blower and the steam from plant #4 is used to gener-ate electricity from a steam turbine generator set. Exhaust steam from these two turbines is used for process heat.

Chapter 8: Steam Power Cycles. In a practical power plant one may find various combinations of closed and open feedwater heaters. For example the Gavin Power Plant has one open- and 7 closed-feedwater heaters in each of the two sections of the plant (refer to the Case Study at the end of this section).
