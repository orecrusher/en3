The sand passing through a screen with clear openings of 7.62 mm is known as the gravelly sand. It is generally used for concrete work. Bulking Of Sand: The presence of moisture in sand increases the volume of sand. This is due to the fact that moisture causes film of water around sand particles which results in the increase of volume of sand.

## Sand Extraction: 1. Introduction 
Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete for each tonne of cement the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS 2013b). Thus the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.
