A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals or mineraloids. Some rocks such as limestone or quartzite are composed primarily of one mineral – calcite or aragonite in the case of limestone and quartz in the latter case. Other rocks can be defined by relative abundances of key (essential) minerals; a granite is defined by proportions of quartz alkali feldspar and plagioclase feldspar.
