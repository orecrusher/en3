## How iron is made 
The process of extracting iron from ore produces great quantities of poisonous and corrosive gases. In practice these gases are scrubbed and recycled. Inevitably however some small amounts of toxic gases escape to the atmosphere. A byproduct of iron purifiion is slag which is produced in huge amounts.
