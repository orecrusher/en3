## Design of hammer mills for optimum performance 
 · Abstract. Hammer mill manufacturers are under increasing pressure to deliver mills of high productivity with a reduced level of vibrations. However in practice excessive wear of the rods carrying the hammers takes place and cracks develop in the vicinity of the holes holding the rods with the hammers with the possibility of breakaway fracture and disastrous consequences.
