## Ilmenite smelting: the basics 
In ilmenite smelting the iron content of the oxide is also lowered by reduction to metallic iron but this takes place in the liquid state at a much higher temperature (of around 1650°C). Ilmenite smelting thus yields two products: a titania-rich slag and molten iron. This is in contrast with the Becher process where the iron is removed as

## The Ironmaking Process 
The molten iron has a dissolved carbon content of approximately 3.6% as well as some silicon manganese vanadium and titanium. Slag which floats on top of the iron has the function of removing impurities from the iron and its chemical composition and temperature to a large extent determine the chemistry and hence quality of the iron.
