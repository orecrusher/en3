## Extract copper and gold from low
Extract copper and gold from low-grade ores more efficiently. Ore deposits are becoming increasingly complex to treat and grades continue to deteriorate in known reserves. For instance approximately 15-20 per cent of the world's current gold production involves refractory ores that must be pre-treated prior to downstream recovery by cyanidation.

## An electrochemical study of the copper
Gold and copper often occur together in ores an occurrence which creates processing difficulties since cyanide leach solutions are not selective for gold. Copper contamination can result in serious problems throughout the conventional carbon-inpulp process often making the operation uneconomic. This thesis describes electrochemical studies of two ways of dealing with copper contamination.
