 · Cone crushers have a crushing chamber that is revolved around its centre axis and crushing does not occur all at once but in a circular motion. This property gives rise to a potential non-optimal crushing in the form of power draw fluctuations due to the variance in feed across the crushing chamber with respect to e.g. mass flow particle size distribution and other material properties.
