Bond Work Index. In the 1930s through early 1950s Bond developed a new theory of comminution that introduced an index called the 'Bond Work Index' which relates power consumption in crushing and grinding to the feed and product size distribution. His theory and index were introduced in a widely cited 1952 journal article. Bond called his theory the "third theory of comminution" counting

## Grindability 
The standard Bond test is time consuming and a number of methods have been used to obtain the indices related to the Bond work index. Smith and Lee (1968) used batch-type grindability tests to arrive at the work index and compared their results with work indices from the standard Bond tests which require constant screening out of undersize material in order to simulate a closed-circuit
