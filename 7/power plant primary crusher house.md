 · A slightly more common configuration connects two feeders together at their endpoints with a normally open tie switch. This primary loop increases reliability by allowing customers downstream of a fault to receive power by opening an upstream switch and closing the tie switch. The only customers that cannot be restored are those in switchable section where the fault occurred.

If the preferred feeder becomes de-energized a transfer switch disconnects the preferred feeder and connects the alternate feeder. Secondary selective service achieves similar results by using switches on secondary voltages rather than primary voltages.
