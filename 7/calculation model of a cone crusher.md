 · Trickle feeding a cone crusher should be avoided because it not only results in poor productivity and poor product shape but it can also adversely affect bearing alignment within said crusher. Due to the operational characteristics of a cone crusher when crushing it should never be operated below 40 percent rated horsepower.

## Aggregate Equipment Review – Cone Crushers: Direct Drive 
Cone crushers are critical pieces for aggregate production mineral processing operations and recycling appliions. They're typically a secondary or tertiary rock crusher and produce a fine or medium-sized aggregate material. Since cone crushers have a large feed opening and small discharge sizes this type of aggregate equipment has a high crushing ratio making them quite efficient on

## Dynamic modeling and simulation of cone crushing circuits 
Abstract As a common practice steady-state models are used for simulation and process dimensioning of crushing circuits. However intended circuit performance is rarely achieved due to constantly fluctuating feed-material size and characteristics. This gap between theoretical and realized performance has the potential for process control.

## Cone Crusher Performance 
Cone crushers are used by both the aggregate producing and the mining industry. Both industries are interested in increasing the product quality while at the same time lowering the production costs. Prediction of crusher performance has been focused on since crushing is a vital process for both industries. In the thesis a method for prediction of cone crusher performance is presented.
