## Bridge expansion joints ndash; performance and materials 
Expansion joints are used in bridges to allow movements like expansion and contraction between the bridge deck spans and abutments. These movements are caused due to temperature soil settlements vehicle acceleration and other reasons (Klaiber et al. 1987 and Dagher et al. 1993 as cited in Thippeswamy 2002).

## ABUTMENTS 
ABUTMENTS. Abutments support the ends of the bridge and transfer the loads from the superstructure into the ground. The abutments also support the bearing devices and the backwalls. Abutments are usually constructed of concrete. The abutment seat is the most vulnerable part of the abutment especially on bridges with leaking expansion joints.

## Bridge Design
 · 1. Expansion and Contraction (Uniform Temperature) Maximum and minimum shade air temperatures have been recorded at weather stations over many years. These records are used to predict the maximum and minimum design temperatures that the bridge deck may experience during its design life.These temperatures are presented in the codes in the form of isotherm maps.

## [PDF] EVALUATION OF FAILURE IN BRIDGE EXPANSION JOINT 
Strip seal expansion joint systems are composed of two structural parts; the rail and the concrete deck. Failures of expansion joints can be due to failures of either one of these components or a combination of both. The results of this investigation have indied that the failure of the expansion joints in McAllen was due to a failure in the concrete part of the system.

Bridge bearings also makes rooms for relative movements between superstructure and substructure for instance rotation movements and translational movements in horizontal and transverse direction. Bearing used in the construction of bridge structure is divided into two major egories namely expansion bearings and fixed bearings.

## Joint Sealants 
These problems are caused when incompressibles obstruct pavement expansion in hot weather and create compressive pressure along the joint faces. History Sealant use dates back to 1906 when heated tar was first placed between concrete slabs on projects in eastern cities including Washington D.C. and Summerville Mass.
