## Hardrock Mining Techniques
Underground mining (hard rock) Underground hard rock mining refers to various underground mining techniques used to excavate hard minerals such as those containing metals like gold copper zinc nickel and lead or gems such as diamonds. In contrast soft rock mining refers to excavation of softer minerals such as coal or oil sands. Mine Access

## How Underground Mining Works 
Underground mines are the alternative to surface mines. Surface mines excavate from the top down a method that can become inefficient at depths greater than about 200 feet (60 meters) [sources: Illinois Coal Association De Beers].Undergrounds coal mines can drive 2500 feet (750 meters) into the Earth and other types even deeper -- uranium mines can reach 6500 feet or 2 kilometers.

 · Initial capital investment for the mining methods ranged from $ for chamber and pillar to $ for block caving using LHD's. Mining costs including all direct indirect and fixed costs except royalty and lease payments ranged from $1.04 per ton for chamber and pillar to $1.35 per ton for block caving using LHD's.

## Recognised standard 01 
This standard applies to electrical equipment and electrical installations below ground in an underground coal mine and electrical equipment and electrical installations on the surface directly associated with the underground operations of a coal mine. This standard does not apply to the general surface of an underground coal mine.
