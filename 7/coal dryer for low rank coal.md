## Lower Rank Coal 
Low-rank coals are high in moisture or ash content and susceptible to spontaneous combustion. Since low-rank coals are high in moisture using them as fuel in energy-producing facilities like power plants increases coal consumption emitting more CO2 and lowering power generation efficiency.
