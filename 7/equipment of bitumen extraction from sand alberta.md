## In Situ Methods used in the Oil Sands 
In Situ Methods used in the Oil Sands In situ methods are used to recover bitumen that lies too deep beneath the surface for mining (about 80% of the oil sands in Alberta). The success of in situ methods depends on the resolution of two major issues: 1) reducing the viscosity of bitumen so that it will flow and 2) recovering the bitumen from deep within the earth (OSDC 2008c).

## Oil Sands Mining 
Oil sands mining involves excavating oil sands using trucks and shovels and transporting it to extraction plants to separate the bitumen from the sand. To separate bitumen from Alberta's oil sands mining operations transport materials to large processing and upgrading facilities that require large volumes of readily available water for the bitumen separation process.

The hot water separation process as practiced by the Research. Council of Alberta involves increasing the water content to about 12% by means of hot water and/or steam while the oil sand is being heated to a temperature of about 176°F. (80°C.) during which time a certain amount of mixing or kneading of the oil sand takes place.

## Oil Sands Science and Research 
Extraction of heavy oil called bitumen is an important component of Canada's economy. Alberta provides over 15% of Canada's GDP and almost a third of that is from resource extraction. Unfortunately Canadian oil resources are more difficult and expensive to extract with higher environmental consequences than many other world crude oil resources making it less desirable to world markets.

Bitumen spill in Alberta raises questions about extractionBut in the last thirty years new methods of extraction have been developed. One of these involves drilling and inserting pipes into bitumen deposits and using these pipes as conduits to inject high temperature-high pressure steam underground This separates the bitumen from the sand which then can be pumped out.

Bitumen is produced via two primary methods: thermal in situ recovery using steam and mining and extraction of bitumen from oil sands. Current production capacity is roughly split at 50% thermal recovery and 50% mining and this trend is expected to continue. Most of the mined bitumen currently produced is being upgraded directly in Alberta.
