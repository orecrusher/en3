Different percentages of iron content reflect both the natural variation in iron ore grades found in mine deposits and the degree of processing (if any) employed to upgrade the ore for a certain use. In general higher purity ores help increase hot metal yields in the blast furnace and also lower production cost by reducing the amount of coke required.
