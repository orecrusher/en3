## Mining Minerals p2 
The exploration phase for the DeLamar silver mine began in 1969 and by 1977 open pit mining was started. In 1986 ore reserves totaled approximately 11 million tons averaging 1.8 ounces per ton of silver (and 0.023 ounces per ton of gold).

## Reducing Lead and Silica Dust Exposures in Small
 · However it is likely that other mining areas beyond the few loions that have been surveyed are facing similar lead hazards without knowing it. In addition extremely high exposures to silica dust have been measured in small-scale mining and the presence of silica in ore is certainly not confined to any geographic area.

 · Asian governments clamp down on domestic mining. Silica sand is a little similar to iron ore in terms of having several grades although with silica sand having one type suitable for concrete another necessary for making flat glass a higher grade for specialty glass and yet another step up for the quality needed for silicon chips.
