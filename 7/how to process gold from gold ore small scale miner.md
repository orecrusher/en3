## Mercury Amalgamation and Fine Gold Recovery 
 · The first use of mercury in a large scale mining process was 1828 but evidence suggests that the use of mercury to extract gold from ore may have been first used over a thousand years ago. It is popular among small scale prospectors because it is cheap and simple to use. This was not necessarily the case for larger scale mining operations.

Gold mining is a global business with operations on every continent except Antarctica and gold is extracted from mines of widely varying types and scale. Mines and gold mining operations have become increasingly geographically diverse far removed from the concentrated supply of four decades or so ago when the vast majority of the world's gold came from South Africa.

## Sustainable Responsible Mining I Cyanide
The Clean Mining gold recovery process developed by Australia's CSIRO replaces cyanide and mercury with a safer less hazardous chemical reagent. This alternative gold recovery solution is non-toxic and dissolves fine gold out of ores into a solution which can then be recovered through further processing.

## Smelting and Roasting Ores to recover gold silver and 
The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.

A: It's true that pyrite from gold mines will contain a small amount of gold. It is microscopic and is found inside the pyrite crystal. Miners who process gold ores will get free gold particles that can be melted into bars but they also recover pyrite that has small amounts of gold within it. Often the majority of the gold is in the free

## » The Basics of Successful Gold Mining
While some gold-bearing creeks and rivers tend to have gold values dispersed throughout their entire streambeds there is generally not enough gold to make a small-scale mining operation payoff very well. Because we are limited as to how much gravel we can process as small-scale miners we need to find higher-grade deposits.

The lifecycle of a gold mine. People in hard hats working underground is what often comes to mind when thinking about how gold is mined. Yet mining the ore is just one stage in a long and complex gold mining process. Long before any gold can be extracted significant exploration and development needs to take place both to determine as accurately as possible the size of the deposit as well

## Gold Refining 
 · The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold. The Miller process is rapid and simple but it produces gold of only about 99.5 percent purity. The Wohlwill process increases purity to about 99.99 percent by electrolysis.

## The Gold Smelting Process 
 · Gold miners have to smelt their gold in order to remove impurities resulting in pure gold. Most large scale gold miners send their ore to smelters with large equipment for the smelting process. Small scale miners still can do their own smelting using specialized kilns. Many people confuse gold smelting with melting.
