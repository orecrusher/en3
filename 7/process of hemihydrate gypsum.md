## Determination of Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate and Hemihydrate 
Without gypsum hydrated calcium aluminate crystallizes within about 10 min; gypsum retards this process by several hours or even days depending on the gypsum content. In the quality control of cement it is therefore important to know the exact content of the CaSO4 dihydrate or hemihydrate.

Gypsum is moderately water-soluble (~2.0–2.5 g/l at 25 °C) and in contrast to most other salts it exhibits retrograde solubility becoming less soluble at higher temperatures. When gypsum is heated in air it loses water and converts first to calcium sulfate hemihydrate (bassanite often simply called "plaster") and if heated further to anhydrous calcium sulfate ().

## process of hemihydrate gypsum 
Process for preparing calcium sulphate hemihydrate Process for preparing calciumsulphate hemihydrate by recrystallizing calciumsulphate dihydrate e.g. gypsum obtained by digestion of phosphate ore using concentrated nitric acid at elevated temperatures. The diluted acid is concentrated by absorption of nitrous gases and recycled in the process.
