## Complexity
It is known that geometry of cutting tool affects the cutting forces in machining operations. In addition the value of cutting forces changes during machining operations and creates a chaotic time series (signal). In this paper we analyze the variations of the complex structure of cutting force signal in rough end milling operation using fractal theory.

 · A feature on a variety of high performance end mills variable helix or variable pitch geometry is a subtle alteration to standard end mill geometry. This geometrical feature ensures that the time intervals between cutting edge contact with the workpiece are varied rather than simultaneous with each tool rotation.

Analysis of cutting forces in machining operation is an important issue. The cutting force changes randomly in milling operation where it makes a signal by plotting over time span. An important type of analysis belongs to the study of how cutting forces change along different axes. Since cutting force has fractal characteristics in this paper for the first time we analyze the variations of

## Deciding on Best Depth and Width of Cut When Milling 
I got a note recently from a G-Wizard user who wanted to know how to decide on best depth and width of cut when milling. It's a great question. Most machinists I suspect use rules of thumb and habit more than anything else unless the situation dictates something in particular based on the dimensions of the feature being machined.

## End mill 
An end mill is a type of milling cutter a cutting tool used in industrial milling appliions. It is distinguished from the drill bit in its appliion geometry and manufacture. While a drill bit can only cut in the axial direction most milling bits can cut in the radial direction. Not all mills can cut axially; those designed to cut axially are known as end mills.
