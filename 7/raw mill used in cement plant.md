## Cement Plants: Clays and Shales
Alluvial clay was the first to be used in Portland cement in the Thames valley (and although the source of clay used by Joseph Aspdin in Yorkshire is unknown it was most probably also alluvium). Early cement manufacturers ascribed almost magical qualities to the alluvium of the Medway estuary and even distant plants (e.g. Shoreham ) used it obtaining supplies by coastal barge.

Cement plants are usually built near the quarry of limestone so the quarried limestone can be transported to the cement plant directly by belt conveyor or other conveying systems. If the distance between the quarry and the cement plant is too long to use conveyors the limestones will have to be transported by trucks which means higher transportation fees and inconvenience.
