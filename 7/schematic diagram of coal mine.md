## Mountaintop removal mining 
Mountaintop removal mining (MTR) also known as mountaintop mining (MTM) is a form of surface mining at the summit or summit ridge of a mountain. Coal seams are extracted from a mountain by removing the land or overburden above the seams.This process is considered to be safer compared to underground mining because the coal seams are accessed from above instead of underground.

## 7.3.2: Contour Mining 
 · Under certain conditions we may choose to take advantage of the exposed coal seam and develop an underground mine or practice highwall mining which will be discussed later in this lesson. Now let's take a look at a schematic view of contour mining approach and then a photo of a contour mining site. The diagram shows more than one coal seam.

the 1970s coal mining was an integral part of many communi­ ties in the Front Range Urban Corridor. There has been no commercial coal mining in the Denver Basin for more than 20 years however and the likelihood of any significant revival of coal mining seems remote at this time (2004). This is due
