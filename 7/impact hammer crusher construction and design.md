## Crushers and Sieves 
For example for primary crushing one type of crusher is used (for example a jaw crusher). In order to receive medium-sized particles a different type of crusher is required (for example an impact crusher). If you need to get a finer fraction you'll need a third type of crushers (hammer roller etc.).
