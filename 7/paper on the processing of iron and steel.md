## Steel manufacture 
Iron and steel making by-products. As with all large-scale manufacturing processes the production or iron and steel generates by-products. On average the production of 1 tonne of steel results in 200 kg (EAF) to 400 kg (BF/BOF) of by-products. The main by-products produced during iron and crude steel production are slags (90%) dusts and sludges.

## Iron Steel 
Steel is an alloy of iron plus a variety of other ingredients such as coke limestone manganese aluminium and nickel depending on the alloy's use. Pieces of steel scrap are chemically analysed to determine their alloy composition and sorted by type. Scraps are then melted down for reuse in the production of new iron and steel production.
