## Cement: Materials and manufacturing process
• Chalk is porous and often has high moisture content that leads it to its use in the 'semi-dry/wet' manufacturing process of making cement. This particular process represents some 16% of total production. Shale • Shale is a pure sedimentary rock made of very fine silt clay and quarz. Shale falls in the egory of mudstones.
