Normal-weight aggregates are typically natural crushed stone whereas lightweight aggregates are produced by heating clay shale or slate in a rotary kiln at temperatures on the order of 2000°F. At these temperatures the aggregates expand and develop a network of interconnected internal pores (Figure 1) ranging in size from 5 to 300 microns (Chua 2009).
