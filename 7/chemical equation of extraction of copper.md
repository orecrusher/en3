## Extraction of Metals 
The chemical reactivity of metals also determines their method of extraction. Native metals undergo physical separation processes such as froth flotation. Froth flotation uses detergents to create floating bubbles that adhere to metal particles while other materials settle out and are removed separately.

## copper extraction and purifiion 
Copper can be extracted from non-sulphide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulphuric acid to produce a very dilute copper(II) sulphate solution. Concentration of the copper(II) sulphate solution by solvent extraction.

## Chelation 
Chelation / ˈ k iː ˌ l eɪ ˈ ʃ ə n / is a type of bonding of ions and molecules to metal ions. It involves the formation or presence of two or more separate coordinate bonds between a polydentate (multiple bonded) ligand and a single central atom. These ligands are called chelants chelators chelating agents or sequestering agents.

## Methods of Extraction 
Extraction of Metals. The Earth's crust contains metals and metal compounds such as gold copper iron oxide and aluminium oxide. Useful metals are often chemically combined with other substances forming ores.; A metal ore is a rock that contains enough of the metal to make it worthwhile extracting.

 · Chemical precipitation is the most widely used for heavy metal removal from inorganic effluent. The conceptual mechanism of heavy metal removal by chemical precipitation is presented in Eq. (1) Wang et al. 2004 : (1) M 2 + + 2 ( OH ) − ↔ M ( OH ) 2 ↓ where M 2+ and OH − represent the dissolved metal ions and the precipitant respectively while M(OH) 2 is the insoluble metal hydroxide.

Extraction of Metals. Extraction of Copper.. Copper is sometimes found as native metal.. Copper ores include copper(II) oxide and copper(II) sulfide. Copper(II) oxide can be reduced by reaction with carbon.. Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper. These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so valuable.
