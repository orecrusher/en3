Iron ore is the unrefined substance utilized to formulate pig iron which is one of the most important untreated materials to compose steel. 98% of the hauled out iron ore is used to produce steel. Uncontaminated iron ore is almost nameless on the exterior of the Earth apart from the combination of Fe-Ni alloys from meteorites and very atypical forms of unfathomable mantle xenoliths.
