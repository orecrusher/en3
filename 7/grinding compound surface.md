## Best Practices for Surface Finishing 
 · Grinders have a tendency to follow the wavy contours of the rough surface which makes it difficult to develop the smooth or flat surfaces required for subsequent stoning. Whenever possible direct the grinding strokes at a 45-degree to 90-degree angle relative to the grooves developed in the machining process.
