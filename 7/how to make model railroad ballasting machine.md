## Overfitting in Machine Learning: What It Is and How to 
When we run the model on a new ("unseen") dataset of resumes we only get 50% accuracy uh-oh! Our model doesn't generalize well from our training data to unseen data. This is known as overfitting and it's a common problem in machine learning and data science. In fact overfitting occurs in the real world all the time.
