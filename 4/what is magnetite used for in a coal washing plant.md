## Heavy Media Separation Process
 · The heavy-media separation process or HMS employing ferrous media usually ferrosilicon and/or magnetite is the most generally used process for sink-float separations. A stable medium over the range of specific gravities from 1.25 to 3.40 can be maintained within close limits and is cleaned and recovered by magnetic means.

## Magnetite Recovery in Coal Washing by High Gradient 
Fine magnetite mixed into a water suspension is commonly used in coal preparation to create a pseudo- specific gravity great enough to effect separations between coal and associ- ated impurities. The magnetite must not only be reclaimed but must also be cleaned to prevent coal and impurities from building up in the washing cir- cuit. The reclaimed coal fines have economic value.

## Determination of Magnetite in Dense
Abstract. Magnetite losses are generally significant in commercial coal cleaning plants using high-density medium techniques. It is common practice to monitor the cleaned coal slurries and refuse using a Davis Tube method in order to isolate and correct unnecessary losses.

## Coal Processing Plant 
 · The wash plant to the lower left probably uses wet screens and scrubbers to remove clay and shale from the coal. The media plant to the upper right is used to separate harder rock from the coal. The two round tanks are thickeners the larger one probably for tailings and the smaller one for magnetite used in the heavy media process for refining coal.

Magnetite however can be re-used in the coal upgrading process without the use of industrial chemicals. Magnetite mixed with aluminium oxide can provide you with an abrasive known as 'emery' which is a natural mixture of magnetite and corundum.
