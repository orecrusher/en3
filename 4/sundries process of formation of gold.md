¬†¬∑ Most mineral deposits are formed by more than one process so attaching a single label to them is difficult. Hence there is a tendency to talk about Stillwater Complex type or Carlin-type gold deposits which rather defeats the purpose of finding a general from the specific. There are two main approaches to mineral deposit classifiion.

## How Diamonds Are Formed 
¬†¬∑ Oil and natural gas reserves fresh highly fertile soils and gold silver uranium and diamonds are all formed at convergent plate boundaries. The presence of microdiamonds within rocks of continental affinity suggests that these rocks despite their intrinsic buoyancy were subducted into the upper mantle to a minimum depth of 150 km and subsequently exhumed to the earth's surface.
