## Review on Beneficiation Techniques and Reagents Used for 
Many beneficiation techniques can be employed to upgrade the P2O5 grade of phosphate ores based on their characteristics in chemical composition and texture. The flotation process is most widely applied to balance the P2O5 recovery ratio and cost. In this review the dominant techniques for the beneficiation of phosphate ores are introduced.

In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.

 · Many beneficiation techniques can be employed to upgrade the P2O5 grade of phosphate ores based on their characteristics in chemical composition and texture. The flotation process is most widely applied to balance the P2O5 recovery ratio and cost. In this review the dominant techniques for the beneficiation of phosphate ores are introduced.

## Coal Mining and Production 
Strip mining is one of the most economical surface processes. Here removal of overburden and coal extraction proceed in parallel strips along the face of the coal deposit with the spoil being deposited behind the operation in the previously mined areas. In open pit mining thick seams (tens of meters) are mined by traditional quarrying techniques.

## What is Beneficiation? 
For rare resources beneficiation is critical because it takes advantage of every scrap of material available. This practice can also make a marginal mining facility more practical than it might otherwise be and may in fact be used to extract ore from a facility previously believed to be exhausted.
