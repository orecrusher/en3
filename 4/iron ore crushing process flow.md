## Crushing in Mineral Processing
 · In mineral processing or metallurgy the first stage of comminution is crushing.. Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate/surface.

Iron makes up close to 5% of the Earth's crust. It takes around 1.6 tons of iron ore to produce one ton of steel. The chemical symbol for iron is 'Fe' because of its Latin name Ferrum. We use 20 times more iron (in the form of steel) than all other metals put together. Our iron ore trains are over 2.5km (264 ore cars) long meaning it can take
