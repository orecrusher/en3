However no correlation of aggregate properties with asphalt concrete was attempted [9]. El -Basyouny and Mamlouk in 1999 evaluated the effect of aggregate gradation on the rutting potential [10]. They found that both the aggregate gradation and aggregate nominal size affected the rut depth for pavement section.

Aggregates are generally thought of as inert filler within a concrete mix. But a closer look reveals the major role and influence aggregate plays in the properties of both fresh and hardened concrete. Changes in gradation maximum size unit weight and moisture content can all alter the character and performance of your concrete mix.
