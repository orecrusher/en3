## Concrete blocks 
Concrete blocks are often made of 1:3:6 concrete with a maximum size aggregate of 10mm or a cement-sand mixture with a ratio of 1:7 1:8 or 1:9. These mixtures if properly cured give concrete blocks a compression strength well above what is required in a one-storey building. The blocks may be solid cellular or hollow.
