## Basic End Mills Technical Information 
Ball end mills also known as ball nose end mills are used for milling contoured surfaces slotting and pocketing. A ball end mill is constructed of a round cutting edge and used in the machining of dies and molds. Roughing end mills also known as hog mills are used to quickly remove large amounts of material during heavier operations.

 · The finesse of the material milled by the ball mill is 0.074mm-0.4mm only except for the two small ball mills that have a wider range of 0.075-0.89mm. However the rod mill fine grinding fineness is about 0.833-0.147mm. In terms of the fineness of the ground material the ball mill has a finer handling ability.
