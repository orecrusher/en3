Mine tailings are the waste material that remains after the economic fraction has been extracted from the mineral ore. Tailings consist of a slurry of ground rock and water and chemical reagents that remain after processing. The composition of mine tailings varies according to the mineralogy of the ore deposit and how the ore is processed.

## Quick figures: Morila gold mine's reprocessing of tailings
 · In January the mine produced 3494 ounces of gold and 3372 ounces of gold in February. The mine remains on track to meet guidance. It is intended to commence mining of satellite pits in mid-2021 and to enable processing of this ore multiple capital works programmes are being undertaken at the processing plant and the tailings dam.

 · Here the material is pumped to a processing plant to extract the gold. This operation is much more cost-effective compared to a truck and shovel operation due to the use of slurry transport. However the majority of the tailings are stored together with process water which makes hydraulic monitoring of dry heaps impossible.
