## Fine grinding of industrial minerals 
 · Fine grinding is a process stage that is necessary for all industrial minerals some of which have to be ground to the submicron range. The following contribution provides an overview of the important industrial minerals their manufacturing processes the fineness requirements and the processes employed for dry and wet grinding. 1.

## What is Grinding? 
 · For example through crushing the mineral ore to below a certain size and finishing by grinding it into powder the ultimate fineness depends on the fineness of dissemination of the desired mineral. Grinding can be done wet or dry depending on the process in use but for dry grinding the materials first may need to be dried in cylindrical rotary dryers.
