## Data Mining vs. Data Warehousing 
Data warehousing and data mining techniques are important in the data analysis process but they can be time consuming and fruitless if the data isn't organized and prepared. Data preparation is the crucial step in between data warehousing and data mining. Once the data is stored in the warehouse data prep software helps organize and make sense of the raw data.
