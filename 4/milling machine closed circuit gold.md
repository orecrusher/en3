## Closed Circuit Grinding VS Open Circuit Grinding
 · Closed circuit grinding consists of one or more mills discharging ground product to classifiers which in turn return the coarse product from the size separation back to the mill for further grinding. In this circuit grinding efficiency is very dependent upon the size separation effected so care should be exercised in selecting the type and size of classifier used to close the system.
