## Iron Ore Mining Explosives Pattern
Iron Ore Mining Explosives Pattern. Iron ore was won by drilling and blasting .As mining technology generally developed so did drilling techniques and the explosives used. Smith 1990 reported that the Cleveland deposit was associated with a very strong stone roof rock known as dogger allowing mine drivages to be self-supporting.

## Benchmark Seismic Explosives 
Matching explosive energy to geology enables expanded patterns without affecting fragmentation. This in turn increases the drilling yield providing more tonnes per drill metre. Products and procedures for safely sleeping blasts allow less frequent and larger blasts reducing production delays and increasing blasted inventory without employing more drills or blast crew resources.
