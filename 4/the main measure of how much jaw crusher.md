## Jaw Crushers 
Jaw Crushers are sized by the top opening of the crushing chamber. For example a 32 x 54 Jaw Crusher measures 32" from jaw die to jaw die at the top opening or gape opening and 54" across the width of the two jaw dies. The narrower bottom opening of the crushing chamber is used to size the discharge material.

When a sample arrives it is first crushed and sieved. This is to obtain the correct grain size for the rest of the separation process. The ideal grain size is 0.25-0.50mm. There are two crushing machines available; a jaw-crusher and a disc-pulverizer. Samples are usually run through the jaw-crusher first and then the pulverizer.

Jaw Crushers. In compression crushing jaw crushers tend to be more of a blunt instrument compared to cone crushers which is why they're often used in the primary rock crushing circuit stage. Jaw crushers are also known as "rock breakers" and are used to break up larger harder materials into more manageable pieces.
