## Animal Feed Pelleting 
Pellet fed hogs not only gain faster but they do it with less feed for each pound of weight increase. Pelleting prevents the segregation of ingredients in a mixing handling or feeding process. By feeding a pelleted feed the animal is more apt to receive a totally mixed ration than one that has separated through these processes.
