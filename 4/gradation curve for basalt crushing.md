 · Gap-graded soils have coefficients of curvature < 1 or > 3 and one or more humps on the gradation curves. Procedure of Particle Size Analysis: A sample of dry soil is poured onto the top sieve the nest is covered and it is then shaken by hand or mechanical sieve shaker until each particle has dropped to a sieve with openings too small to pass and the particle is retained.

## Sieve analysis 
A sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used in civil engineering and chemical engineering to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material by allowing the material to pass through a series of sieves of progressively smaller mesh size and weighing the amount of material that is stopped by each sieve as a fraction of the whole mass.

Tables 1 through 5 have gradation guidelines for D50s of 4 inches through 12 inches. The smaller (i.e. 1 and 2 inch) diameters shown should be considered as "weight of material" rather than "number of rock." The tables can be used to produce gradation sample piles showing the upper and lower limits of the desired gradation.
