 · As iron ore and steel prices have skyrocketed in the last year U.S. demand could soon lessen depending on the Biden administration's actions. A potential infrastructure bill would bring investment into America's steel mills to build supply for the future and any walkbalk on the Trump administration's 2018 tariffs on imported steel could further soften supply constraints.

 · The most obvious symptom of iron deficiency in plants is commonly called leaf chlorosis. This is where the leaves of the plant turn yellow but the veins of the leaves stay green. Typically leaf chlorosis will start at the tips of new growth in the plant and will eventually work its way to older leaves on the plant as the deficiency gets worse.
