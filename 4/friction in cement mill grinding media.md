## 5 Ways To Improve Grinding Efficiency Of Ball Mills 
 · Several factors affect the efficiency of a ball mill for cement grinding. In this article we shall be looking at some of these factors that have been proven to influence grinding efficiency: Mill Geometry And Speed. According to Bond (1954) the grinding efficiency of a mill depends on the ball mill diameter size of the media and mill speed.

## Progress with grinding aids for VRMs 
 · In ball mills where the grinding time is longer than in a VRM excessive powder flowability can lead to insufficient or inefficient grinding because the material flows too fast through the mill. In contrast to ball mills VRMs have a very high internal circulation a short mill retention time and a huge number of classifying steps that carry the well-dispersed fines out of the mill system.

## Grindability 
As the comminution performance depends on the grinding load (which is different for vertical roller mills in comparison to ball mills) the sample characterization must be adapted as well. For the Zeisel and Hardgrove grindability tests the feed sample with its precisely defined particle size is crushed by pressure and friction between a grinding bowl and grinding balls.
