## Copper 
Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29. It is a soft malleable and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity.A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color.Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity as a building material and as a constituent of various metal alloys such as sterling

## Impacts of copper mining on people and nature 
The mining industry uses sulphuric acid in the extraction and treatment of copper. The extraction processes are called heap and situ leaching; during these processes particles react with each other to create acidic mists that not only harm people's skin eyes and lungs but also destroy crops deteriorate the quality of the land and damage

## New process for extracting copper 
 · Contrary to aluminium however there are no direct electrolytic decomposition processes for copper-containing sulphide minerals to produce liquid copper. The MIT researchers found a promising method of forming liquid copper metal and sulphur gas in their cell from an electrolyte composed of barium sulphide lanthanum sulphide and copper sulphide which yields greater than 99.9% pure copper.

Process steps include mining concentration roasting smelting converting and finally fire and electrolytic refining. 12.3.2 Process Description2-4 Mining produces ores with less than 1 percent copper. Concentration is accomplished at the mine sites by crushing grinding and flotation purifiion resulting in ore with 15 to 35 percent copper.
