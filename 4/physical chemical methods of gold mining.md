## Tailingsfo What Are Tailings? 
Not surprisingly the physical and chemical characteristics of tailings and their methods of handling and storage are of great and growing concern. Tailings are generally stored on the surface either within retaining structures or in the form of piles (dry stacks) but can also be stored underground in mined out voids by a process commonly referred to as backfill.

## What is Gold Extraction? (with pictures) 
When gold is mined it must be extracted from its surrounding materials. Gold extraction refers to the methods used to remove gold from its raw state in gold ore. A number of processes are employed to achieve extraction including separating the gold from its surroundings by physical force exposure to heat or chemical means.

## Methods of Gold Mining 
Other gold mines use underground mining where the ore is extracted through tunnels or shafts. South Africa has the world's deepest hard rock gold mine up to 3900 metres (12800 ft) underground. At such depths the heat is unbearable for humans and air conditioning is required for the safety of the workers. The first such mine to receive air

## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching – An Introduction 
 · A paper published by L. Elsner in 1846 first correctly identified the chemical reaction that forms the basis of all gold cyanide leaching processes: 4 Au + 8 NaCN + O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 4 Na [Au (CN) 2] + 4 NaOH. The equation is well known but the successful appliion of this reaction in a gold mining operation is rarely straightforward.
