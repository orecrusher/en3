## Copper Smelting Process 
 · Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper being further processed in a converter furnace. Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity. Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised
