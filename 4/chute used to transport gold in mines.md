## Hints and Tips 
The building or mine will build by itself eventually and it will probably take you more time to regain the spent gold than it did to just wait for the construction to finish. Never spend gold to upgrade a track to the 30% speed boost unless (a) it is a mine you plan to constantly refresh using engineers (a good tactic with level 4 coal mines) or (b) it is a mine you have upgraded to level 5.

Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold. Partially due to cyanide modern mines are. much larger than before cyanide was used; create vast open pits; and; produce huge quantities of waste. More than 20 tons of mine waste are generated to produce enough gold for a typical ring.
