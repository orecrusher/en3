Introduction:- Casting is the one of the oldest manufacturing processes and even today is the first step in manufacturing most product. In this process the material is first liquefied by proper heating and then this liquefied is poured into a previously prepared mould cavity where it is allowed to solidify and subsequently the product is taken out cleaned and trimmed to the required shape.
