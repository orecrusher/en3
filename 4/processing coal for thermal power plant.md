## Thermal Power Plant Thermal 
☛ THERMAL POWER PLANT OPERATION. The working principle of thermal power plant operation depends on Rankin Cycle. In a thermal power plant coal is coming from coal storage and burnt in the boiler.It converts water into steam. This steam is expanded in the prime-mover (i.e. turbine) which produces mechanical power driving the alternator coupled to the turbine.
