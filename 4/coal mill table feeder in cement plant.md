## Gravimetric and Volumetric Coal Feed Systems for Boilers
The gravimetric feeder compensates for the variation in bulk density and feeds a fixed weight of coal in response to a boiler fuel demand. This ability to accurately weigh the coal provides significant improvement over volumetric types in terms of matching the fuel delivered by the feeder to the actual process energy required on coal fired units.
