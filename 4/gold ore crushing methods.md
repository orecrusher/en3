Gold mining is the process of mining gold ores from the ground up till the stage where pure gold is extracted (Richiewiki 2010). The gold ores are usually big and. have to be crushed to reduce them to a size of about 12mm diameter before pure gold can be extracted from them. The ore usually has to pass various crushing stages each reducing
