## What is the purpose of adding gypsum in cement? 
Gypsum is a mineral and is hydrated calcium sulfate in chemical form. Gypsum plays a very important role in controlling the rate of hardening of the cement. During the cement manufacturing process upon the cooling of clinker a small amount of gypsum is introduced during the final grinding process. Gypsum is added to control the []

## Cement Manufacturing Process 
 · Cement Manufacturing Process Phase 1: Raw Material Extraction. Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium silicon iron and aluminum. Such raw materials are limestone clay and sand. Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand clay fulfill the need of silicon iron and aluminum.

## Project Report on CEMENT FROM CLINKER 
Clinker when added with gypsum (to control the setting properties of cement and ensure compressive strength) and ground finely produces cement. Clinker can be stored for long periods of time in a dry condition without degradation of quality hence it is traded internationally and used by cement manufacturers when raw materials are found to be scarce or unavailable.

## Cement clinker 
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilie materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.

## Cement: Materials and manufacturing process
The clinker is then cooled and ground to a fine powder in a tube or ball mill. A ball mill is a rotating drum filled with steel balls of different sizes (depending on the desired fineness of the cement) that crush and grind the clinker. Gypsum is added during the grinding process to provide means for controlling the setting of the cement.

The cement industry is one of the most intensive energy consumers in the industrial sectors. The energy consumption represents 40% to 60% of production cost. Additionally the cement industry contributes around 5% to 8% of all man-made CO 2 emissions. Physiochemical and thermochemical reactions involved in cement kilns are still not well understood because of their complexity.
