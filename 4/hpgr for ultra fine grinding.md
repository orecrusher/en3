## HPGR High Pressure Grinding Rolls 
What is HPGR? Used in mining appliions for the last 30 years high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) reduce particles by compressing and crushing the feed between two counter rotating parallel rollers with a small gap between them. This forces the rocks against each other and compresses the feed's density to 80% of its solid volume

## Iron Ore Concentrate Particle Size Controlling Through 
 · Nowadays the HPGR (high-pressure grinding rolls) is an intermediate step between filtering and balling in the most modern iron ore pelletizing operation. The operation debottlenecks filtering process and reduces pressure over the typical milling process to control particle size to the balling. The present study evaluated aspects of microwave appliion to the iron ore concentrate fed to HPGR

## Quantifying the energy efficiency of fine grinding 
In previous publiions we have described how the size specific energy (SSE) can be calculated to predict the energy required to generate new minus 75 µm material. However if we want to benchmark the performance of fine grinding where the product can be much finer than 75 µm clearly we require a finer marker size. If we do this we also need a way to compare results that

 · Despite that the ultra-fine generation evaluated based on the particle size (% < 45 μm) had a lower slop increase than the one observed in a traditional ball mill/HPGR circuit (which reached 1810 cm 2 /g and 91.16%); even after seven recirculation steps the % < 45 μm resulted 12% lower.

## How energy efficient is HPGR?
Fine-grinding and ultra-fine grinding of ore or concentrates in conventional ball mills results in energy consumptions that increase exponentially with product fineness. Wipf (2009) presented a flowsheet in which he proposed the installation of HPGR ahead of the Aerosion 'Disintegrator' for ultra-fine grinding of ores and/or concentrates.
