Percolation Heap leaching (see Mular et al. pp. 1571–1630 loc. cit.) is very widely applied to the ores of copper and precious metals but percolation is also conducted on a smaller scale in batch tanks or vats and in continuous or dump extractors. In the heap leaching of low-grade oxidized gold ores for instance a dilute alkaline solution of sodium cyanide is distributed over a heap of

 · Corrosionpedia Explains Leaching. Leaching is the selective corrosion in which one element is removed from a solid solution alloy. The gradual loss of zinc from brass (dezincifiion) is perhaps the most well-known example of this type of corrosion but aluminum can also be leached from aluminum bronzes (dealuminifiion) and nickel from 70/30 cupronickel alloys (denickelifiion).

## Tank leaching 
Tank leaching can be performed as a batch process but is normally operated as a continuous process. Leaching is usually carried out in a series of tanks. In a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) series leaching is co-current i.e. a pulp of ore/concentrate and leaching reagents are pumped into the first reactor and then allowed to overflow to the following tanks in the reactor series.

Leaching takes place in a series of agitated leach reactors or pachucas.
