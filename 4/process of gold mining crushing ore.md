## THE MINING PROCESS 
Generally the ore is crushed into fine particles before being heaped and sprayed with a leaching solution which liquefies and separates the gold from the ore. Our process at Lomati Mine begins with trenches being dug and soil samples being taken at specific intervals within the trenches to test the quality of the ore along that channel.

## Chapter 2: An introduction to mining 
Mineral processing usually requires reducing the particle size of the ore a process called comminution followed by separating ore and gangue minerals and concentrating ore minerals. The mined ore is tipped into a crusher crushing the blasted rock from the mine to smaller pieces usually the of small stones or gravel.

## Stamp mill 
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps loosely held vertically in a frame in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp the stamp falls onto the ore below crushing the rock and the lifting process

## The Mining Process 
The ore now goes through a three-stage processing cycle to ensure the gold is economically recovered from the ore. Stage 1: Crushing and Grinding. Ore stockpiled from underground and open pit mines is fed into the primary crusher at the process plant. The jaws inside crush the rock down to fit through the 125mm gap at the bottom.
