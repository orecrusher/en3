## Fluid bearing 
Fluid bearings are noncontact bearings that use a thin layer of rapidly moving pressurized liquid or gas fluid between the moving bearing faces typically sealed around or under the rotating shaft. The moving parts do not come into contact so there is no sliding friction; the load force is supported solely by the pressure of the moving fluid.
