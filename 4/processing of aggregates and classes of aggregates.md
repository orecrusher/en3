## Density of Aggregate 
Key Features: If the volume is unit then Bulk Density= Mass. Unit in kg/m 3 or lb/ft 3. In this definition the volume is that contains both the aggregates and the voids between aggregates particles. The approximate bulk density of aggregate that is commonly used in normal-weight concrete is between kg/m3 (75-110 lb/ft3) .

## Aggregation – NDSU Soil Health
Aggregation – Arrangement of primary soil particles (sand silt clay) around soil organic matter and through particle associations. Aggregate stability is a good indior of soil health. When you pick up a handful of soil and it breaks apart into little pieces you are looking at soil aggregates. Each aggregate is made up of soil particles

In the early stage of the aggregation process the suspension mainly contains individual particles. The rate of this phenomenon is characterized by the aggregation rate coefficient kSince doublet formation is a second order rate process the units of this coefficients are m 3 s −1 since particle concentrations are expressed as particle number per unit volume (m −3 ).

Aggregate is also used for base and subbase courses for both flexible and rigid pavements. Aggregates can either be natural or manufactured. Natural aggregates are generally extracted from larger rock formations through an open excavation (quarry). Extracted rock is typically reduced to usable sizes by mechanical crushing.
