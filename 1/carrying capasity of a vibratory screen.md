Vibration is accomplished by eccentric weights on the upper and lower ends of the motion-generator shaft. Rotation of the top weight creates vibration in the horizontal plane which causes material to move across the screen cloth to the periphery. The lower weight acts to tilt the machine causing vibration in the vertical and tangential planes.
