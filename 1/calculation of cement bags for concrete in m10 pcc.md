## Rate Analysis of Plain Cement Concrete (PCC) Calculate 
 · For 1m3 of wet or solid Plain Cement Concrete (PCC) ratio (1:3:6) we have to multiply with factor 1.52 for dry density than 1m3 become 1.52m3 of cement sand aggregate is required due to presence of voids in sand in dry state. So cement sand and aggregate quantity is calculated for 1.52m3 of PCC. Dry volume = 1.52 m3.
