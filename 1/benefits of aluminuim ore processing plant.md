## The 7 Benefits of Recycling Aluminum to Help the Environment
 · By reusing it the entire planet sees the benefits of recycling aluminum. It comes from the earth primarily in Guinea and Australia. It's shipped around the world to processing plants. While aluminum is an extensive drain on the environment and so easily recycled Americans send one billion tons of recyclable aluminum to landfills each year.

## 10 benefits of recycling 
 · What are the benefits of recycling aluminium?: Making products from recycled materials requires less energy than creating them from raw materials. Sometimes the difference is immense for example producing new aluminium from recycled cans and foil uses 95% less energy than starting from scratch.

## Aluminium Production Process 
The Bayer process dissolves the aluminium component of bauxite ore in sodium hydroxide (caustic soda); removes impurities from the solution; and precipitates alumina tri hydrate which is then calcined to aluminium oxide. A Bayer Process plant is principally a device for heating and cooling a large re circulating stream of caustic soda solution.

Aluminum ore (bauxite) must first be mined then chemically refined through the Bayer process to produce an intermediate product aluminum oxide (alumina). Alumina is then refined through the Hall–Héroult process into the pure metal by an electrolytic process. Aluminum is 100 percent recyclable without loss of its properties.

## The Manufacture of Aluminium Sulfate
Alum (as aluminium sulfate is commonly called) is manufactured in a simple two-step process from aluminium trihydrate and sulfuric acid according to the following reaction: 2Al(OH)3 + 3H2SO4 + 8H2O → Al2(SO4)3 .14H2O ∆fH = -156 kJ mol-1 The first step involves mixing the ingredients in a reactor and the second is the process of

## Ore Beneficiation 
Aluminum-containing minerals in iron ore are detrimental to blast furnace and sinter plant operations. The two major aluminum-containing minerals in iron ore are kaolinite (Al 2 (Si 2 O 5)(OH) 4) and gibbsite (Al(OH) 3). Some progress has been made in using flotation to separate kaolinite from hematite.
