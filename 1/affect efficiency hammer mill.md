AIt is generally believed that roller mills utilize energy more efficiently than hammer mills (Silver 1931; Puckett and Daum 1968; Appel 1987). To verify this a completely randomized factorial experimental design (CRD) with two repliions was constructed: a total of 72 grinding tests was conducted to compare the energy efficiency between a roller mill and a hammer mill.
