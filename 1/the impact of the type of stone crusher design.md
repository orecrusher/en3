Key points. • 'Aggregate' is a term for any particulate material. It includes gravel crushed stone sand slag recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregate may be natural manufactured or recycled. • Aggregates make up some 60 -80% of the concrete mix. They provide compressive strength and bulk to concrete.

Crushed stone is produced by crushing quarry rock boul-ders cobbles or large-size gravel. Crushed air-cooled blast-furnace slag is also used as fine or coarse aggregate. The aggregates are usually washed and graded at the pit or plant. Some variation in the type quality cleanli-ness grading moisture content and other properties is expected.
