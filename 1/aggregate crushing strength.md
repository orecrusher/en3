## What is Crushed Aggregate? (with pictures)
Crushed gravel is an aggregate frequently used in construction. The stone and aggregate industry creates crushed aggregate using a lengthy process. The stone must be mined in a quarry and then transported to the rock crusher which begins the process of crushing the larger stones into more manageable pieces.
