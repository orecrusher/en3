## Are You Mining Minerals for Cement or for Concrete?
 · Cement manufacturers mine and process raw materials and put them through a chemical reaction process to create cement. They need to understand the chemical composition of the raw materials so that the reaction in their process takes place correctly and they make good high quality cement that will eventually be used to make concrete by contractors and "ready-mix" companies.
