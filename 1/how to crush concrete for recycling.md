## Concrete Recycling 
Concrete (ca 35 €/ton 90 €/m 3) is the largest structural material in terms of volume: EU production of ready mixed concrete is about 300 million m 3 per year. At the End-of-Life phase concrete is mainly land filled or recycled into road-based aggregate (RBA) quite often in a mix with other mineral waste materials (bricks tiles) from the same building.
