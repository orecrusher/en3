## Total Guide to CNC Jigs Fixtures and Workholding 
A jig holds the workpiece and also guides the cutter. Given CNC there's little need for jigs as the g-code guides the cutter so the term is largely related to manual machining. "Fixtures" are colloquially workholding solutions that are custom made for a particular part or situation.

## Workholding – use of vices 
Use of vices to hold workpieces. Apart from using clamps the most common way of holding a workpiece is by using a vice. In most cases the vice is bolted to the milling table. This is probably the most common set-up for either vertical or horizontal milling. It is usually faster to set-up a workpiece for machining using a vice than using clamps.

## An Introduction to Workholding 
 · An Introduction to Workholding. In CNC milling the term "workholding" encompasses all the components required to keep the work secure while milling the block of material. It starts simply when holding parts with square edges but becomes more difficult for parts with complex profiles and changes entirely when mass production is concerned.

## The Many Sides of Workholding 
 · Workholding requirements can be affected by many factors including the material being cut critical tolerance requirements workpiece shape and dimensions and frequency of change-over. High volume machining has a different set of requirements than those for a job shop with closer attention to consistent quality over longer periods of time.
