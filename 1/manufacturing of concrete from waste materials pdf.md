Precast concrete is also friendly to downcycling in which building materials are broken down because it comes apart with a minimum amount of energy and retains its original qualities. An example of downcycling would be the use of crushed precast concrete as aggregate in new concrete or as base materials for roads sidewalks or concrete slabs.
