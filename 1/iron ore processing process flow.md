## Production 
In nature iron occurs as ore. In mining the ore is extracted from the rock and processed. To make iron from the ore it is reduced and melted in a blast furnace with coke at over 1300°C. The resulting pig iron contains more than 2% carbon and cannot be used for products in this form.
