## Hammermills versus roller mills 
 · Roller mills simply "roll" or "crush" product between two revolving cylinders. This latter process has the distinct advantage of requiring considerably less power although it is not possible to achieve the fineness of final grind through a roller mill that can be achieved through a hammermill.

In any roller mill the rolls will need to be removed periodically for recorrugation. This very important detail must be carefully studied when roller mill selection is made and the installation is laid out. Generally one roll is fixed in the frame and the opposing roll can be adjusted to set the clearance or gap between the rolls.
