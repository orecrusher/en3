EXTRACTION OF IRON IN A BLAST FURNACE Iron is also below carbon in the reactivity series so therefore carbon can be used to reduce it (note: reduction can also mean to remove the oxygen from a compound). This is done in a blast furnace. The most common ore of iron is called haematite (iron(iii) oxide). Its formula is Fe 2 O 3.

 · The first step in the steel manufacture begins at the blast furnace. To separate iron from iron ore coke (substance when gas is taken out of coal) limestone and dolomite are charged into the blast furnace. Temperature raised to 1600oF. This high temp causes the coke to burn and melt the iron. This red hot iron drained at an opening at the base of the furnace.

Extraction of Metals. Extraction of Iron.. Iron is extracted from its ore in the blast furnace.. The main iron ore is called haematite. Haematite is iron(III) oxide - Fe 2 O 3. The iron ore contains impurities mainly silica (silicon dioxide). Limestone (calcium carbonate) is added to the iron ore which reacts with the silica to form molten calcium silie in the blast furnace.

 · The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process. The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace. These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.

Extraction of Metals. History ().. After the Bronze Age came the Iron Age. People discovered that a high temperature coal fire could be used for the extraction of iron from iron ore. The extraction of iron today is done in a blast furnace.. The Iron Age began in Asia and Africa in 1100 B.C. and came to Britain in 500 B.C. In many ways we are still in the Iron Age - take a look around.
