## How concrete is made 
The manufacture of concrete is fairly simple. First the cement (usually Portland cement) is prepared. Next the other ingredients—aggregates (such as sand or gravel) admixtures (chemical additives) any necessary fibers and water—are mixed together with the cement to form concrete. The concrete is then shipped to the work site and placed

## The Cement Manufacturing Process 
 · Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay to a fine powder called raw meal which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 °C in a cement kiln. In this process the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are
