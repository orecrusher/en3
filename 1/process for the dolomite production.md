Dolomite is used as an ornamental stone a concrete aggregate and a source of magnesium oxide as well as in the Pidgeon process for the production of magnesium. It is an important petroleum reservoir rock and serves as the host rock for large strata-bound Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) ore deposits of base metals such as lead zinc and copper.

## Magnesium: extraction
Step 1： Dolomite ore is crushed and heated in a kiln to produce a mixture of magnesium and calcium oxides a process known as calcining: Step 2： The next step is reduction of the magnesium oxide. The reducing agent is ferrosilicon (an alloy of iron and silicon) which is made by heating sand with coke and scraps iron and typically contains about 80% silicon.
