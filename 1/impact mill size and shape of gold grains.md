## Recrystallization Anneal 
Metallurgical effects of recrystallization anneal. During a recrystallization anneal new grains form in a cold-worked metal. These new grains have a greatly reduced number of disloions compared to the cold-worked metal. This change returns the metal to its pre-cold-worked state with lower strength and increased ductility.

grain structure. Metals have a crystalline structure - this is not usually visible but can be seen on galvanized lamp posts for example. When a metal solidifies from the molten state millions of tiny crystals start to grow. The longer the metal takes to cool the larger the crystals grow. These crystals form the grains in the solid metal.

The flatter shape of the particles would thus give the gold the appearance of similar sized particles but would actually have a lower mass than a more rounded particle of gold of the same size. Thus the particle shape is allowing a lighter gold particle to fall into the same size fraction as a similarly weighted sulphide particle and the equally settling particles would be extremely difficult

## Factors that Affect the Yield Strength of Metals 
Some grains start growing at the expense of other grains till the complete structure is covered by bigger grains. This is called secondary re-crystallization and grain growth. The mechanical properties like yield strength depend upon the grain size. The relationship between grain size and flow stress is given by the Hall-Petch formula (Eqn. 1.14).
