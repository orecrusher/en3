## Calculating Stockpile Capacity
 · Calculating Stockpile Capacity: Once the minimum storage capacities which will assure maximum mill output are known the appropriate stockpile configuration must be determined. Stockpiles fall into two general egories: conical and elongated. Conical Stockpiles The conical stockpile is the simplest and easiest to analyze. The total stockpile capacity is given by: 3.14 (Tan A)R³ D/3000

The expanding appliions of vibratory feeders for controlling the flow of bulk materials and their adaptation for processing requirements have developed a considerable interest in stockpiling and reclaim systems. The general design of these units consists of a material transporting trough (or platform) driven by a vibratory force system.
