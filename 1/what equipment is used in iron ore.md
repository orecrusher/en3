## iron processing 
iron processing - iron processing - Ores: Iron ores occur in igneous metamorphic (transformed) or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary but many have been changed by weathering and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3) which is
