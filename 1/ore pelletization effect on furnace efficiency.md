## Iron Ore Pelletization Technology and its Environmental 
The process of pelletization enables converting Iron Ore Fines into "Uniformed Sized Iron Ore Pellets" that can be charged into the blast furnaces or for Production of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI). Pellets are uniform size with purity of 63%- 65% contributing to faster reduction and high metallization rates.

In blast furnace (BF) iron making lime stone is used as source of CaO to neutralize the all acidic oxides present in iron ore and make fluid slag of suitable basicity. Limestone is the most common source of CaO abundantly available and it has very good strength properties also which make it suitable for using in blast furnace.

The ores are ground to a fine particle size to separate unwanted impurities and con-centrate the iron oxide. The fine grain of the concentrate is then agglomerated into larger particles to allow further processing in blast furnaces. The most common technology in the iron ore industry to agglomerate concentrate fines is pelletization.
