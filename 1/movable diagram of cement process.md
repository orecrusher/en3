## How Concrete is Made 
How Concrete is Made. In its simplest form concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates or rocks. The paste composed of portland cement and water coats the surface of the fine (small) and coarse (larger) aggregates. Through a chemical reaction called hydration the paste hardens and gains strength to form the rock-like mass known as concrete.

## How concrete is made 
Concrete made with Portland cement is considered superior to that made with natural cement because it is stronger more durable and of more consistent quality. According to the American Society of Testing of Materials (ASTM) Portland cement is made by mixing calcareous (consisting mostly of calcium carbonate) material such as limestone with silica- alumina- and iron oxide-containing materials.
