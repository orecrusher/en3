## CO2 emissions by fuel 
Carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from energy and material production can arise from various sources and fuel type: coal oil gas cement production and gas flaring.. As global and national energy systems have transitioned over centuries and decades the contribution of different fuel sources to CO 2 emissions has changed both geographically and temporally.

## What Is Xylene? 
Commercially xylene can be produced through the alytic reforming process as well as by the carbonisation of coal during the manufacture of coke fuel. The industrial production of xylenes on the other hand is accomplished by adding methyl groups to toluene and benzene.

## Biomass
The most proﬁtable aromatics reﬁneries consistently produce p-xylene while o-xylene reﬁneries consistently have the lowest required investment costs. The net present values for the biomass to aromatics BTA reﬁneries producing 2000 t per day of product are as high as $1200 MM dollars with payback periods less than 10 years.

## USB2 
Processes and apparatus for making xylenes and phenol are described. Phenol and alkyl phenols are separated from coal derived liquid. The phenol is separated from the alkyl phenols. The alkyl phenols can be reacted with aromatics such as benzene and toluene to make xylenes. The xylenes and other aromatics are then separated from the phenol and alkyl phenols.

## Difference Between Toluene and Xylene 
 · The production of xylene can be done by alytic reforming during petroleum refining or by coal carbonization during the manufacture of coke fuel. However industrially xylene production method we use is the methylation of toluene and benzene. Xylene is important as a nonpolar solvent. It is however expensive and comparatively toxic.
