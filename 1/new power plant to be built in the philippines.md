## Power Plant Explained 
 · The next type of power plant we will look at is a solar power plant. This type of plant uses the suns energy to convert into electricity. This is achieved by using Photovoltaic or PV panels made up from a number of semiconductor cells that release electrons when they are warmed by the thermal energy of the sun.
