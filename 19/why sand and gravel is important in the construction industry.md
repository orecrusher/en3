## Sand rarer than one thinks 
Why is this issue important? Globally between 47 and 59 billion tonnes of material is mined every year (Steinberger et al. 2010) of which sand and gravel hereafter known as aggregates account for both the largest share (from 68% to 85%) and the fastest extraction increase (Krausmann et al. 2009).

## Sand Extraction: 1. Introduction 
Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete for each tonne of cement the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS 2013b). Thus the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.
