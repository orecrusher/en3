## Cement Production 
The production of cement is either through the wet or dry process with the dry process as the preferred option because of the lower energy intensity. Cement production accounts for about 5% of total anthropogenic emissions (IFC 2017). Cement-based structures constitute the largest surface area of all man-made structures (Odigure 2009).
