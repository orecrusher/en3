## Lime Production: Industry Profile
2.1.1 Crushing The first step in the manufacturing of lime is to crush the pieces of limestone to make them smaller. There are two basic types of primary crushers: compression and impact. Compression crushers use slow steady amounts of pressure to reduce the size of the rock whereas impact crushers rely on intense repeated blows.

Track ballast forms the trackbed upon which railroad ties (sleepers) are laid. It is packed between below and around the ties. It is used to bear the load from the railroad ties to facilitate drainage of water and also to keep down vegetation that might interfere with the track structure. Ballast also holds the track in place as the trains roll over it.
