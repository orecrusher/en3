## Five tips for sealing a water well 
 · 2. 3. After you reach water with any drilling project it is time to put the tools away and rest in a job well done — almost. Before you hang up your work boots you must seal your well to protect it from surface water contamination. Without proper sealing surface water may enter the borehole and contaminate the well water.

Borehole Development: Now is time to remove drilling mud cuttings and loose sediment from the bottom of the well and from around the screen. This process which promotes the movement of water into the well is called development. We use the technique called Air lift which is basically a compressed air injected into the borehole.

## Borehole mining — Wikipedia Republished // WIKI 2
Borehole Mining (BHM) is a remote operated method of extracting mineral resources through boreholes based on in-situ conversion (liquefaction) of ores into a mobile form (slurry) by means of high pressure water jets (hydraulicking). This process can be carried-out from land surface open pit floor underground mine or floating platform or vessel through pre-drilled boreholes.
