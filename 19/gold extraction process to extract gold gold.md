## How Cyanide Leaching is Used in Gold Mining 
 · How the Extraction Process Works. Cyanidation is not used to extract large size gold nuggets from ore because the process is deemed too slow and is not cost effective. In mining operations that contain larger free-milling type gold deposits stamping and traditional gravity separation methods are more effective.

## A green process for extracting gold 
 · The gold is already metallic so it doesn't need to be extracted from ore. The cyanide would be used for this. Heat would separate glass plastic and metals from the gold.

## Gold Processing Methods Gold Ore Extraction
 · Gold Processing Methods Gold Ore Extraction. Of all the methods of extracting gold processing it from its ore I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study. The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation cyanidation and gravity concentration. Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized

 · This process is performed either by hand or machines and involves removing any non-gold materials from the board including integrated circuits screws and batteries. Once these extra pieces have been removed and safely discarded the actual gold reclamation process can begin. Gold can be removed from circuit boards in a variety of ways.
