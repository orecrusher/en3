## Tailings dam 
A tailings dam is typically an earth-fill embankment dam used to store byproducts of mining operations after separating the ore from the gangue. Tailings can be liquid solid or a slurry of fine particles and are usually highly toxic and potentially radioactive.Solid tailings are often used as part of the structure itself. Tailings dams rank among the largest engineered structures on earth

Another important distinction with tailings dams is that they are not necessarily always sited at the end of a valley as is typically the case with conventional dams.

The long service life of closed tailings dams merits careful consideration in design for closure. This paper provides an overview of some typical closure work components for tailings dams.

## Mine Tailings 
Mine tailings are the finely ground residue from ore extraction. The grain size of the tailings depends on the nature of the ore and the milling process. Size measurements (Robertson 1994) of tailings from four mines in Ontario Canada indied the tailings materials to be predominantly silt and fine to medium sand with <10% clay content.
