The aluminothermic reduction process of manganese oxide from different slags by aluminum was investigated using pure Al and two types of industrial Al dross. Two types of MnO-containing slags were used: a synthetic highly pure CaO-MnO slag and an industrial high carbon ferromanganese slag. Mixtures of Al and slag with more Al than the stoichiometry were heated and interacted in an induction
