Fine grinding or milling reduces the particle size down to as low as 1.0 micrometer (μm) (4 x 10-5 in.) in diameter. Ball mills are the most commonly used piece of equipment for milling. However vibratory mills attrition mills and fluid energy mills also are used.

The starting point for ball mill media and liquid charging is generally as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 45% to 50% above the ball charge for total of 58%
