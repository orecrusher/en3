## Understanding dressing percentage of slaughter tle 
Dressing percentage is calculated by dividing the warm carcass weight by the shrunk live weight of the animal and expressing the result as a percentage. For example suppose that an animal delivered to the packing plant weighs 1300 pounds. After being killed the hide head feet and gut are removed. The warm carcass then weighs 767 pounds.

## CHAPTER 1 MINERAL DRESSING 
The ore lumps from the mines have the lump size of 10 - 100 cm while the individual minerals have grain sizes below 0.1 mm. Hence the first step in any ore dressing plant is to aim at liberation by size reduction or comminution. Comminution of any ore is carried out in several stages using different crushing equipments.
