The transport properties of fault zones are critically important in predicting subsurface fluid behavior in deformed rocks and understanding fold and thrust belts. Limestone-dolomite composite rocks are common components of fold and thrust belts and are also productive reservoir rocks for hydrocarbons. This study develops a methodology for measuring the permeability of experimentally induced

It is noticed that the points from the red polygon are coming from limestone while points corresponding to the dolomite zone are enclosed by the blue polygon. Using the crossplot shown in Figure 3 the relationship between LI and Pe curve is derived which can then be used for obtaining Pe volume from the seismic data as shown in the crossplot in Figure 3.

## Limestone 
Carbonates (limestone and dolomite) share many of the characteristics of sandstone. Resistance to weathering—Because of their crystalline nature carbonates are ridge formers that produce steep slopes and sharp forms particularly in arid regions. Dolomite is more brittle than the more plastic limestone.

 · Like many of you I've been curious as to what exactly the difference between the two is so I did some research and here is what I found. Simply put Dolomitic Limestone is just a variant of Limestone (a sedimentary rock) consisting of mainly magnesium calcium carbonate instead of calcite and aragonite. Dolomitic Limestone is also known as "Dolomite" and is often preferred over

 · Dolomite content of 25% to 50% referred to as dolomitic limestone. Dolomite Crusher – a kind of dolomite as the main component of carbonate rocks. Often mixed with calcite clay minerals gypsum and other impurities. Very similar appearance with the limestone dripping hydrochloric acid (5%) very slow to weak or non-foam foam.
