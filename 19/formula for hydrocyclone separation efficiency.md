Multiple investigations on hydrocyclones have been carried out since the 1950s (Kelsall 1952). Now a commonly accepted wisdom is that the separation characteristics of the hydrocyclone depend on the flow field and turbulence intensity of which has a major impact on hydrocyclone's classifiion efficiency (Teja et al 2014).

When classifying slurries the separation efficiency (or the performance) of the hydrocyclone is described by the cut-size and the sharpness of classifiion coefficient collectively referred to as a partition curve. These separation efficiency indiing parameters cannot be measured in real-time and are thus quantified by utilising models.

The results have shown that suppress- ing the air core improves the separation efficiency of the hydrocyclone. Efforts have been made to explain the concept through fundamentals of fluid flow in hydrocyclone. The air core has a significant effect on particle separation as the relative density of the particles approach to the fluid density.

Due to this complexity many authors have produced correlations for both the separation efficiency and the pressure drop in hydrocyclones. Reviews have been published by Bradley (1965) and Svarovsky (1984). The centrifugal force that is generated is capable of separating particulate solids down to around 5 to 10 microns in size.
