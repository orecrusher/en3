After being crushed the materials could be discharged by gravity or downward thrust from the swing jaw. In the 1980s the commonly used jaw crusher were the double-toggle jaw crusher and the single-toggle jaw crusher. Unlike the former the single-toggle jaw crusher could also move up and down therefore it was called complex swinging jaw crusher.
