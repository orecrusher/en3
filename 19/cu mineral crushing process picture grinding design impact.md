alumina zirconia. During rolling of vessel the grinding media powder particles roll from some height. This process grinds the powder materials by impact/collision attrition. • Milling can be dry milling or wet milling. In dry milling about 25 vol% of powder is added along with about 1 wt% of a lubricant such as stearic or oleic acid.
