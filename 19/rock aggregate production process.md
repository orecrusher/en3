Rock quarries usually operate for at least 30 years and are developed in distinct benches or steps. A controlled explosion is normally used to release the rock from the working face. It is then transported by truck or conveyor to a crusher where it goes through a series of crushing and screening stages to produce a range of final sizes to suit customers' needs.
