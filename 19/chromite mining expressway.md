Numerous pits were dug between the 1870s and 1920s to extract chromite (iron chromate) which was initially used as a pigment and later for steel manufacture. One of these chromite mines was the largest in Britain. Its site at Hagdale contains the remains of a horse drawn chromite crushing circle which has recently been restored.
