A hydrometallurgical process is provided for producing pigment-grade TiO2 from an ilmenite ore concentrate containing by weight a relatively high magnesium content ranging up to about 10 % an iron content of at least about 15 % and a titanium dioxide content of at least about 25 %. The concentrate is selectively leached with hydrochloric acid at a concentration ranging up to about 30 % of

## Cavex® Hydrocyclones 
Hydrocyclones also known simply as 'cyclones' are a classifiion device that uses centrifugal force to selectively concentrate slurry particles through a separation process. This simple process separates the slurry mixture with the larger mass particles leaving through the hydrocyclone underflow and the water and fines exiting through the overflow.
