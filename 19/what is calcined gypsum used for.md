 · Gypsum loses about three-quarters of its molecular water at temperatures of about 180 °C and converts into 2H2O / CaSo4 which is called chalk or calcined. If this material is exposed to water it will reabsorb the lost molecular water and turn it into gypsum or plaster. In fact it results in chalk or calcined gypsum.
