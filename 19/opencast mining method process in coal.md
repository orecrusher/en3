## Basics of an open pit mine 
Open pit mines can be used in coal mining and they are used extensively in "hard rock" mining for ores such as metal ores copper gold iron aluminum and many minerals. In a open pit coal mine the pit bottom would be the bottom mined coal seam elevation since it is usually feasible to extract multiple seams when surface mining coal.

Currently almost 65 % of the coal in Australia is being produced by opencast mining methods. Mining equipments such as draglines dredgers or bucket wheel excavators trucks and shovels and dozers are the main equipments employed for overburden removal and coal extraction. The choice of equipment for a particular mine depends on geological geotechnical and economic factors and other site issues.

The opencast coal mining technique is used in areas were the coal reserves are stered in shallow and thin seams and cannot be extracted by deep mining methods (Beynon et al. 2000). The opencast process starts with exploration activities to identify where there are deposits of coal and what is the depth of the seams.
