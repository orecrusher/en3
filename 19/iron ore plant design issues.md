To resolve this issue Kobe Steel developed a technology for compacting DRI into briquette iron at a temperature of around 700℃. DRI has an apparent density of 3.4 to 3.6t/m3 while the briquette iron has an apparent density of 5.0 to 5.5t/m3. The reoxidation issue had restricted DRI manufacturing sites to the vicinity of steelmaking plants.

## Sintering: A Step Between Mining Iron Ore and Steelmaking
 · Sintering: A Step Between Mining Iron Ore and Steelmaking. The USGS defines iron ore as a mineral substance which when heated in the presence of a reductant will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (Fe2O3). It's a major ingredient in steel.

Iron ore. Iron doesn't occur naturally. Being highly reactive it combines easily with other minerals to form ores. Those with the highest iron content are found near the surface of the earth and are relatively easy to mine. The principal iron ores are hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4). Most iron ore is extracted through opencast mines.
