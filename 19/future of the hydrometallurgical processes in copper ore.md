Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source local environmental regulations and other factors.. As in all mining operations the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

This process consumes 2500 to 3000 kWh · t –1 of copper produced. The copper is deposited on the hode and the gases produced at the anode (O 2 Cℓ 2) are recovered selectively and returned to the process. This method produces an extremely pure copper that can then be rolled (hot or cold) drawn or even formed into tubes before being sold.
