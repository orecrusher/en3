Here's the logic behind the center-to-center distance formula: 2C: Multiplying the center-to-center distance by 2 accounts for the belt length on the top and bottom of the pulleys Note: The pitch created by differing pulley diameters is addressed later in the equation. (D+d ÷ 2): This accounts for the belt length "wrapped around" the outer
