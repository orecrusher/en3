 · Mechanism of size reduction Impact —particle concussion by a single rigid force (hammer). Compression—particle disintegration by two rigid forces (nutcracker). Shear —produced when the particle is compressed between the edges of two hard surfaces moving tangentially. Attrition —arising from particles scraping against one another or against a rigid surface (a file).
