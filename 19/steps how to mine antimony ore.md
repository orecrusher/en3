The Toowong Process enables operations to manage arsenic in ore bodies at the mine site. The product from the Toowong Process is a cleaned concentrate that can be shipped direct to smelters. Using the Toowong Process arsenic can be fixed in an environmentally stable form at the mine site potentially more environmentally stable than its native original form.
