## Hematite and Itabirite 
Hematite has traditionally formed the bulk of global iron ore production and high-grade hematite is often referred to as "Direct Shipping Ore" or "DSO" because it is mined and beneficiated using a relatively simple crushing and screening process before being exported for use in steel mills.
