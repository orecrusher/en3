The process is carried out using a slugging tool or a roller compactor/ tablet press machine. It is important to note that if a tablet press is used for the dry granulation process the powders may not possess enough natural flow to feed the product uniformly into the die cavity resulting in varying degrees of densifiion leading to non-uniform granules when they are milled.

## Understanding Fluidized Bed Powder Coating 
 · Rector: One of the upsides to fluidized bed coating is the fact that virtually 100% transfer efficiency is obtained. Powder either melts to the part or remains in the fluidized bed. The downside is in the charging of the tank. A tank large enough for the part must be charged with the coating which—for large parts—can be a substantial amount

 · Laminar flow hoods are often used to work with biological samples semiconductors or other sensitive materials. According to the CDC the laminar air flow principle was first developed in the early 1960s. It's still incredibly relevant for modern labs having literally shaped the way air safely moves in many generations of laboratory enclosures.
