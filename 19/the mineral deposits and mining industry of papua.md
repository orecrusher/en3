## The mineral deposits and mining industry of Papua
Mineral deposits in Papua include those of gold copper and manganese and from these there has been produced gold; silver; copper copper matte and copper ore; manganese ore; osmiridium and platinum. The gold has been obtained from alluvial deposits and lodes and from the copper deposits. Silver has been obtained along with the gold but no separate record of it has been kept.

## Mineral Deposits Mineral Systems and Mineralising Events 
The mineral systems approach to mineral deposit genesis originally proposed by Wyborn et al (1994) attempts to provide a framework that considers all the geological processes that control the formation and preservation of mineral deposits. An overview of the major mineral systems of Australia is given by Jaques et al. (2002).

## The Role of Geologic Mapping in Mineral Exploration 
 · Geologic mapping provides many types of information essential both in exploration for new mineral deposits and during subsequent mining. Geologic mapping of outcrops is used to describe the primary lithology and morphology of rock bodies as well as age relationships between rock units.
