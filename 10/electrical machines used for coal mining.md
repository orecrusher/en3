Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits called coal beds or seams are near the earths surface while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nations coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## Mining vehicles 
 · In 1912 for example the Hoadley Knight Machine was developed for mining coal. Primitive by modern standards it used an electric motor hydraulic swings and water sprays to breakdown rock faces. Since the early 1900s there have been great advancements in continuous mining vehicles but most still consist of rotating steel drums with tungsten teeth which dislodge chunks of coal.
