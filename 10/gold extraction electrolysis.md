## Electrolytic Refining 
The electrolytic process is similar to gold except that the silver anodes are dissolved in a nitric acid bath. The resulting silver will be about 99.9% pure. Copper – The extraction of copper from other ores through electrolysis involves the deposition of copper on the hode and using lead-coated anodes.
