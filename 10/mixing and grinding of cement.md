A grinding aid is a specialty chemical agent used to make it easier to grind and mix cement. Specifically grinding aids prevent cement particles from re-agglomeration or re-adhering during and after the grinding process. Grinding aids make it possible to streamline the cement-making process by increasing process efficiency and material fluidity.
