## Particle Analysis in Mining and Minerals 
Many of the particles encountered in mining are characterized by sieves (classifiers). Recent advances in computers cameras and software make image analysis practical for samples with sizes larger than several microns in diameter. As particle size decreases sieving and/or dynamic image analysis becomes more arduous or impossible and laser diffraction becomes the technique of choice.

## Five stages of gypsum production process 
 · Gypsum production process. Gypsum ore from quarries and underground mines is crushed and stockpiled near a plant. Asneeded the stockpiled ore is further crushed and screened to about 50 millimeters (2 inches) in diameter. If the moisture content of the mined ore is greater than about 0.5 weight percent the ore must be dried in a rotary
