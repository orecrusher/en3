 · An additional problem is a prolongation of the residence time of coal in the mill with increasing fineness which influences the output of the mills and the boiler. The loss due to unburned combustibles (UBC) in slag and fly ash (S UBC ) depends almost entirely on the contribution of coarse fractions in the PF while the energy consumption for coal milling depends mainly on the proportion of

## Understanding Pulverized Coal Injection in Blast Furnace 
 · Coal fineness can be varied in the pulverizer by a number of measures which include varying the coal feed rate the classifier settings or the air flow rate. Although mills can be tuned to suit a particular coal to produce the required size this is not practical in case of a coal blend where a large number of coals are being used.

Importance of Fineness. Higher fineness levels always promote more even distribution of fuel between a pulverizer's separate burner lines. Better distribution promotes better combustion inherently lower NOx emissions and lower flyash L.O.I. or carbon content.

 · There have been very few conversions of UK coal mills from static to dynamic classifiers. But test experience with a dynamic classifier at Powergen's Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station has demonstrated significant fineness gain especially at the coarse end of the particle size distribution curve and minimal effect on mill coal throughput and operability with greatly reduced in vibration levels.
