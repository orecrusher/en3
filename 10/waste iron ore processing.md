## Enhancing the degradation of dioxins during the process of 
Abstract Iron ore sintering is a promising thermal method for co-disposing the municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash. To reduce the increased dioxins in flue gas caused by adding fly ash powder pelletizing was used as a pre-treatment for fly ash to enhance the degradation of dioxins. High specific surface area (5380 cm2·g-1) made the fly ash balls easier to be prepared.

 · In fact some solid wastes in steel industry are essential by products generated during various processing of the materials in the processes involved in the production of iron and steel. For example until the last decade the slag dust and sludge generated by steel industry were called solid wastes but now this term has been replaced by byproduct for these waste materials.
