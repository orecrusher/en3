## The Difference Between Underground Mining And Surface Mining
 · Mining is conducted basically in two ways either underground or surface mining. Surface mines or strip mines are large pits where dirt and rock are removed to expose the minerals. 2. Underground mines are large tunnels that are dug deep into the ground to reach minerals that are too far underground to be reached from surface mines.

 · 7. Hydraulic mining. Hydraulic mining uses water to break the ore away and carry it to the surface. In underground mining one of the most difficult problems to solve is how to get the coal back up to the surface. With hydraulic coal mining water is pushed at high pressure against the ore's surface breaking away the chunks bit by bit.
