## Mining 
For coal mining operations coal mine methane (CMM) erpillar has developed gas generators specifically for CMM gas. Implementing methods to use this gas as an alternative fuel can help: - Improve mine safety. - Mitigate carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere. - Reduce electricity costs and generate revenue.

## The Most Dangerous Gases In Mining: Damp Gases 
The most efficient way of preventing these gases in mines is the incorporation of high quality mining ventilation systems as well as the use of early detection devices. A dangerous mine atmosphere is one that is toxic or explosive and there are several damps that create this kind of atmosphere.

## Commonly used mining techniques to extract coal 
 · Underground mining is more widely used to extract coal compared to opencast mining as many coal seams are said to be found deep below the earth surface. The underground mining includes six type of mining methods that include longwall mining continuous mining room and pillar mining blast mining shortwall mining and retreat mining.

 · Machine learning has only relatively recently been used to improve this process in the mining sector. TOMRA has developed smart sorting equipment for mining which uses color-sorting X-ray transmission or near-infrared sensors to examine every single piece of material moving through the equipment and is able to sort the material based whatever criteria the company wants.

## What are the main methods of mining? 
There are four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels beach sands or other environments.

## Coal Mines in the Industrial Revolution 
Coal mines in the Industrial Revolution were deeper than ever before. Before the 18th century coal was mined from shallow mines. However as the Industrial Revolution gained speed demand for fuel rapidly increased. Before the Industrial Revolution there were two different types of mines: bell pits and drift mines.

In machines which covered the full face steering in the vertical plane could also be a major difficulty. The term "continuous" as applied to development machines has been one of the biggest misnomers used for mining equipment because on development they are usually anything but continuously cutting.

 · Proper mine dewatering is a critical component to every successful mining operation regardless of the type of mining that is being done. If the pumps used for dewatering are too small or there is an insufficient number of them there is a possibility of being flooded out and losing critical equipment and operational time.
