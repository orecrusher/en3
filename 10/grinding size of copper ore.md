## Mineral processing 
Crushing and grinding are the two primary comminution processes. Crushing is normally carried out on "run-of-mine" ore while grinding (normally carried out after crushing) may be conducted on dry or slurried material. In comminution the size reduction of particles is done by three types of forces: compression impact and attrition.
