The collectors available for flotation of oxide minerals are not as selective as the collectors used for sulfide mineral flotation as they attach to the surface by electrostatic attraction rather than by chemically bonding to the surface. As a result there is some collector adsorption onto the minerals that are not intended to float.

 · The froth flotation process. In previous process stages fine particles were created and valuable minerals were released from their carriers also called the gangue. In general flotation is used to separate and recover. The valuables are concentrated and separated from unwanted (gangue) particles. This is done using chemicals and froth.
