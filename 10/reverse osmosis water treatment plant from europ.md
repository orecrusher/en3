Typically reverse osmosis water treatment results in a rejection of dissolved salts that is 95 – 99 percent or greater depending on membrane type feed composition temperature and system design. Reverse osmosis water treatment can provide finer filtration than either nanofiltration or ultrafiltration.

## Design Calculation Of An Reverse Osmosis (RO) Module
 · Reverse osmosis is the most important technique of desalination of brackish ( ppm salt) or sea water (about 35000 ppm or 3.5% salt). Its potential was identified in the 1950s. But commercial exploitation was not possible until the 1960s. The development of high flux asymmetric cellulose acetate membrane by the phase inversion technique of Lobe and Sourirajan (1963) opened
