 · The coke burns and produces energy and the iron ore is reduced due to its reactions with carbon and carbon monoxide. This produces a large amount of carbon dioxide. For example the SSAB steel mill in Raahe causes 7 percent of Finland's CO2 emissions. Fighting climate change has created a need for steel industry involving less carbon consumed.

## Iron and Steel Manufacturing 
rect reduction of iron ore for the manufacture of iron and steel is preferred because it does not require coke manufacturing and has fewer environmental impacts. Wherever feasible pel-letizing should be given preferences over sinter-ing for the agglomeration of iron ore. The following pollution prevention measures should be considered.

## Iron and Steel – Analysis 
Scrap-based production (also referred to as secondary or recycled production) can be valuable in reducing energy demand and CO 2 emissions as it is considerably less energy-intensive than primary production from iron ore. Scrap is used as the main ferrous feed in electric arc furnaces (EAFs) as well as in induction furnaces to a lesser extent.

## Direct reduced iron 
Direct reduced iron (DRI) also called sponge iron is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps pellets or fines) into iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Direct reduction refers to solid-state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting
