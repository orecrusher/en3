## Impact of mechanical resistance of aggregate on properties 
 · Significantly weaker impact on the compressive concretes strength indies a differentiation in the power of conformity of both modulus and strength with aggregate crushing resistance. Considering the strong dependence of modulus of elasticity and deformation of concrete on aggregate crushing resistance (100 % - ACV) one should explain what it results from.
