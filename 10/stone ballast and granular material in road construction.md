## Geogrids in temporary access roads
Temporary access roads are regularly required on construction sites. They provide access for what can be heavy construction vehicles carrying materials and equipment needed to complete the project at hand. Because these roads are required only temporarily they tend to be constructed from a granular fill or aggregate placed on existing ground.
