Draught fans are a type of industrial process fans and are broadly divided into two types – Forced Draft (FD Fan) and Induced Draft (ID Fan). The primary difference between a forced draft and induced draft is FD fan forces outside air into the heating system whereas ID fan draws flue gases from the system out into the atmosphere. Both FD fan

## The Importance of Operating with Proper Furnace Draft 
 · The auxiliary power required for the operation of the induced draft fan(s) pulling gases from the boiler furnace increases as the furnace pressure falls for a given flow of flue gas. The increased fan power is caused by the greater head being developed by the fan and because lower pressure in the boiler causes more tramp air in-leakage; thus more flue gas that has to be handled by the fan.

Industrial induced draft fans operate by focusing the pressure and volume at the inlet of the fan to pull air through a system. Situated above the bundle these fans create negative air pressure. They can work in concert with forced draft fans to maintain efficient and steady air pressure and control the flow using VFDs dampers other
