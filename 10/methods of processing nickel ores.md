## Challenges in processing nickel laterite ores by flotation 
 · It should be added that segregation of laterite ores prior the flotation process has shown some improvement in upgrading nickel. The segregation process relies on the addition of calcium chloride or sodium chloride and carbon allowing the formation of nickel and iron chlorides at temperatures between 900 and 1150 °C.Iwasaki et al.

Nickel ores are not susceptible to mechanical enrichment. The silie nickel ores contain cobalt with the Co:Ni ratio of the order of 1:20–1:30. In some deposits the silie nickel ores are accompanied by iron-nickel ores with high proportions of iron (50–60 percent) and Ni (1.0–1.5 percent).

Hydrometallurgical processing of nickel laterites (limonites or saprolites) requires acidic conditions to dissolve the nickel within the laterite ore. This acidic solution is neutralized in several steps using lime precipitating the dissolved element impurities from solution and recovering valuable base metals (Ni Co Cu) as precipitate products.

The stack of ore is then reclaimed and conveyed onto a secondary heap for final leaching. Bioleaching is an energy-efficient way of producing nickel for example. On the whole the greenhouse gas emissions of the nickel production process are around 40% sulphur dioxide emissions 2% and energy consumption 20% lower than average.

 · One process is the ammonia pressure leach in which nickel is recovered from solution using hydrogen reduction and the sulfur is recovered as ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer. In another the matte may be roasted to produce high-grade nickel oxides; these are subjected to a pressure leach and the solution is electro- and carbonyl refined.

## Nickel (Ni) ore processing 
In the processing of nickel typically lateritic ores or sulfidic ores are first crushed and milled to a fine powder. Water is added to create a pumpable slurry which is treated with reagents during the flotation process in order to concentrate the nickel. Smelting processes the concentrate further creating nickel-rich matte while impurities are removed as slag.
