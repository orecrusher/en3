## Gravity Separation 
Gravity separation has been applied to process chrome slag by steel researchers in India. Heavy media separation (Choudhury et al. 1996) and crushing and jigging (Khan et al. 2001) are the principal techniques used. The slag is subjected to 2-stage crushing to reduce the size to −10 mm and then screened into −10 +1 mm and −1 mm fractions.
