## Advantages and Disadvantages of Aerated Concrete 
Less time required than laying bricks or blocks. Less weight less steel required. Low density low thermal conductivity. Aerated concrete blocks have the density between 400 and 800 kg per cu.m and the thermal conductivity coefficient ranging between 0.1 and 0.21 W/ (mоС) that is why they are light and warm. Good acoustic protection.
