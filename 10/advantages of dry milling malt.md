## The benefits of dry machining 
 · Dry machining is becoming more prevalent in milling especially. In drilling coolant is required because the tool has prolonged exposure to the material and fluid is essential to evacuate the chips. And dry machining in turning is rare as the cutting edge is constantly in contact with the workpiece so without some cooling the cutting edge will eventually fail.
