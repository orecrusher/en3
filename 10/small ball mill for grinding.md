## Milling on a nanoscale 
As a result the grinding energy is significantly increased which allows even smaller particle sizes to be produced compared to other types of ball mills. The rapid acceleration of the particles from one side of the jar to the other produces powerful impact forces between the balls and sample material while also providing additional grinding action through frictional forces.
