 · The smallest ball size typically charged into ball mills and tower mills is ½ inch (12.5 mm) although media diameters as small as 6 mm have been used industrially in Vertimills. In a laboratory study by Nesset et al .[ 7 ] a GIS mill charged with 5-mm steel shot and with other operating conditions similarly optimized achieved high energy efficiencies when grinding to less than 20 μ m.

The overwhelming majority of artisanal and small-scale gold miners utilize mercury to separate gold from the unwanted gangue materials (Telmer and Veiga 2009). Miners use rudimentary tools to mine and process ore adding elemental mercury to amalgamate ﬁne gold particles after grinding the ore in a ball mill and concentrating by panning.

Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills they must be operated in a closed system with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced. Various classifiers such as screens spiral

The CryoMill is a cryogenic grinder designed with user safety in mind. The liquid nitrogen flows through the closed system and the user never comes into direct contact with LN 2 which ensures a high degree of operational safety. The automatic cooling system guarantees that the grinding process is not started before the sample is thoroughly cooled.
