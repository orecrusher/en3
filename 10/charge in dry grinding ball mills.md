While dry milling is less capital intensive it also yields less ethanol per bushel of corn than wet milling (Rajagopalan et al. 2005). Wet milling involves steeping the corn for up to 48 hours to assist in separating the parts of the corn kernel. Processing the slurry separates the germ from the rest of the kernel which is processed further

## Mill (grinding) 
Ball mill. A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill.A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls usually stone or metal which grind material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls. Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%.
