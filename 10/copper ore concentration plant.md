## Ore enrichment 
A mechanical process of copper ore enrichment is essential for effective smelting. The concentration level obtained at the enrichment stage makes the copper material fit for further processing at the smelter. This processing is required due to the fact that the copper ore deposits mined by KGHM in Poland contain on average only 1.52% of copper.
