 · Concentration of Gold Ores – a Key to Reducing Mercury Use in Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining. Posted 3rd June 2012 by Kevin Telmer. In artisanal gold mining mercury is essentially used to concentrate the gold. It does this by bonding with the gold to form a heavy amalgam that is then easily separated from the other minerals.

 · Gold concentration usually consists of gravity separation flotation cyanidation or the combination of these processes. The choice among these processes depends on the mineralogical characterization and gold content of the ore.

Worldwide there are over 43 million artisanal miners in virtually all developing countries extracting at least 30 different minerals. Gold due to its increasing value is the main mineral extracted by at least half of these miners. The large majority use amalgamation either as the final process to extract gold from gravity concentrates or from the whole ore.

Gravity concentration processes rely on the principal that gold contained within an ore body is higher in specific gravity than the host rocks that contain the gold. Elemental gold has a specific gravity of 19.3 and typical ore has a specific gravity of about 2.6. All gravity concentration devices create movement between the gold and host rock particles in

The gravity concentrate from the Knelson concentrators was then transferred to a 1 m3 storage hopper in the gold room after regular intervals depending on Knelson concentrator cycle times. On a daily basis the gravity concentrate was batch fed using an auger feeder to a 40 inch Mineral Cone for secondary gravity concentration.
