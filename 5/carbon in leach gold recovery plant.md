Carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp are continuous processes that use activated carbon in a cascade of large agitated tanks which have been widely used to recover or concentrate precious metals in gold extraction plants. In the carbon-in-pulp process adsorption occurs after the leaching cascade section of the plant and in the carbon-in-leach process leaching and adsorption occur simultaneously.

## GOLD RECOVERY FROM CARBON 
Carbon fines are produced when carbon which is used in a carbon-in-leach (CIL) or carbon-in-pulp (CIP) process for the recovery of gold is broken. Typically these fines loaded to some extent with gold exit from a last adsorption stage of the process and are then lost.
