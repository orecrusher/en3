Limestone that has been "cooked" in this way (the precise term is "metamorphised") transforms into marble. No fossil remains after such a treatment. This is an easy way to make the difference between a limestone and a marble (even if both react when they are in contact with hydrochloric acid): just look if there are any shells in the rock or not.

 · Marble is a metamorphic rock. It is formed from limestone that has gone through a process of recrystallisation through heat or pressure. This gives it a dense crystalline structure that makes a polished surface possible. Marble can vary in colour from the whites and creams of classical sculpture to pinks greens greys browns and yellows.
