During this process these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by breaking of chemical bonds of the raw materials and recombined into new compounds. The clinker is cooled and ground to a fine powder with the addition of about 3 to 5% of gypsum. By this process the product formed is Portland cement.
