 · High-efficiency milling is based on the "radial chip thinning" theory that's been around for a long time. The basic idea is to keep the tool cutting at an ideal chip load. To increase the metal removal rate the stepover is substantially reduced from the typical 50% of tool diameter but the feed rate is increased in order to maintain the correct chip thickness.
