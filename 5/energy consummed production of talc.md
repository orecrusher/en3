## The Flow of Energy: Primary Production
 · The general term " Production" is the creation of new organic matter. When a crop of wheat grows new organic matter is created by the process of photosynthesis which converts light energy into energy stored in chemical bonds within plant tissue. This energy fuels the metabolic machinery of the plant.

This paper provides the theoretical foundation the patents of Nicholas Pittas related to storage and continuous production of energy via compressed air. Specifically the energy balance between consumed energy used for the compression of atmospheric air to high pressure and heat production within a specific number of stages and the energy produced during the expansion of compressed air
