 · Among coal miners more than 90% of the population reports a hearing deficit by age 55. In this formative evaluation focus groups were conducted with coal miners in Appalachia to ascertain whether miners perceive hearing loss as a major health risk and if so what would motivate the consistent wearing of hearing protection devices (HPDs).
