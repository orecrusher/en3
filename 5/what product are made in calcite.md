## Calcite and Aragonite in Earth's Carbon Cycle
 · Aragonite makes needlelike crystals whereas calcite makes blocky ones but many species can make use of either. Many mollusk shells use aragonite on the inside and calcite on the outside. Whatever they do uses energy and when ocean conditions favor one carbonate or the other the shell-building process takes extra energy to work against the dictates of pure chemistry.

## Calcite 
Calcite the most common form of natural calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) a widely distributed mineral known for the beautiful development and great variety of its crystals. It is polymorphous (same chemical formula but different crystal structure) with the minerals aragonite and vaterite and with several forms that apparently exist only under rather extreme experimental conditions.

## Calcite: The mineral Calcite spar information and pictures
Calcite belongs to the calcite group of minerals a group of related carbonates that are isomorphous with one another. They are similar in many physical properties and may partially or fully replace one another forming a solid solution series.All members of the calcite group crystallize in the trigonal system have perfect rhombohedral cleavage and exhibit strong double refraction in

## Calcite 
Calcite can form by direct precipitation from waters rich in calcium. As concentrations increase or the amount of water decreases crystals of solid calcite crystals form. Organisms make structural elements or shells. Many Indiana rock units are made mostly of calcite (fig. 5) crystals or fossil fragments.

## Calcium Carbonate 
Calcium carbonate CaCO 3 is one of the most common compounds on Earth making up about 7% of Earth's crust.It occurs in a wide variety of mineral forms including limestone marble travertine and chalk. Calcium carbonate also occurs combined with magnesium as the mineral dolomite CaMg(CO 3) 2. Stalactites and stalagmites in caves are made of calcium carbonate.

 · Seashells are made when marine mollusks such as snails clams and oysters secrete minerals and proteins through their mantle which is the outermost part of their body that comes in contact with the shells. Shells are made mostly of calcium carbonate; less than 2 percent of their mass is made of proteins. There are no living cells in shells.

Due to the presence of carbonates (CO3) calcite reacts to most acids (such as hydrochloric acid HCl) and effervesces on contact. Most seashells are made of calcite or related minerals.
