## Overburden management in open pits: options and limits in 
 · A wide range of equipment can be utilised for overburden removal in open-cast mining according to the ground type and the topographic context. If the excavated material cannot be reprocessed (either for economic or technical reasons) overburden has to be disposed by means of a range of systems typically combined with excavation techniques according to the overall productivity.
