## Machining Processes: Turning Milling and Drilling 
In machining several operations occur in a planned sequence to achieve the best results. We cover three of the most common operations including turning drilling and milling. Machining is a very common and versatile manufacturing process. Thus it's possible to machine various types of material using these three methods.
