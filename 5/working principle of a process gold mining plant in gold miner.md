 · We've got about 190000 tons above ground which because gold does not tarnish or decay is probably close to the sum total of the gold ever mined. Then on the other hand demand for gold in a year is only about 4000 tons. As you say in principle if a lot more gold came back onto the market we wouldn't need to mine anything for years.
