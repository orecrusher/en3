## Open
Open-pit mining also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit sometimes known as a borrow.. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth such as long wall mining.Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially

Red Mountain CHPP processes both coking and pulverised coal injection (PCI) coal provided from two mine sources Poitrel Mine (BMC) and Millennium Mine (Peabody Energy) bound predominantly for export. The facility utilises a joint venture structure to facilitate the toll treatment of coal on behalf of the two joint venture partners.

where groundwater levels have recovered following the cessation of mining operations. Large areas of North East England have been undermined by coal mine workings. When the mines were active mine water pumping artificially lowered groundwater levels changing the natural drainage patterns and providing man made drainage pathways.

## Environmental issues from coal mining and their solutions 
 · However coal production has changed significantly since the beginning of the 1990â€™s and as a result the way and the extent that mining operations impact the environment are also different now. Fig. 2 shows the change in worldwide coal production over time which illustrates that coal production increased strikingly after 2000.

 · In surface mining the ground covering the coal seam (the overburden) is first removed to expose the coal seam for extraction. The elements of a surface mining operation are (1) topsoil removal and storage for later use (2) drilling and blasting the strata overlying the coal seam (3) loading and transporting this fragmented overburden material (called spoil) (4) drilling and blasting the

## Coal processing 
Automation and control of a coal processing plant is a real challenge. A coal dredge. In order to automate we first need to know the current operating position of the plant and how various changes affect operations – in particular the dense medium cyclone (DMC) circuit which processes 80 per cent of the plant's feed.

## How digital innovation can improve mining productivity 
 · The global mining industry is under pressure. In the short term falling commodity prices are squeezing cash flow. Looking ahead many existing mines are maturing resulting in the extraction of lower ore grades and longer haul distances from the mine face; ore-body-replacement rates are in decline; and new-mine-development times are increasing.
