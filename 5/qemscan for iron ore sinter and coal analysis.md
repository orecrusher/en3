## Iron Ore Statistics and Information 
Iron Ore Statistics and Information. Iron ore is a mineral substance which when heated in the presence of a reductant will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel
