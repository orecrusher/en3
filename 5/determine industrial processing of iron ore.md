 · But as the steel industry seeks lower emissions efficiency and product variability smaller mini-mills have become more successful. If U.S. Steel's experiment at Big River succeeds we could see dramatic change. Companies would still need iron ore but they wouldn't need the traditional taconite pellets produced by existing Range mines.

 · Iron formation consists of iron ore such as siderite magnetite and hematite with silica in the form of chert jasper etc. generally in bands but sometimes not distinctly so. The bands of iron ore are at times high-grade but are often mixed with a good deal of silica the whole making an ore too lean for use without concentration.

## Iron Ore 
Iron ore sintering and pelletizing are the predominant processes in the iron-making industry [12]. During the iron ore sintering process calcium ferrite phase is believed to be the most desirable bonding phase because it has high reducibility and sufficient mechanical strength [3–5].

## Reduction of Iron Oxides with Hydrogen—A Review 
Iron ores always contain some additional gangue. The type and amount depend on the iron ore itself and the beneficiation process. Typical remaining oxides are SiO 2 CaO MgO and Al 2 O 3. Wang and Sohn 43 investigated the effect of CaO and SiO 2 on swelling and iron whisker formation during the reduction of iron oxide compacts.

## Iron Ore Mining 
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
