## Flywheel 
Flywheels are often used to provide continuous power output in systems where the energy source is not continuous. For example a flywheel is used to smooth fast angular velocity fluctuations of the crankshaft in a reciproing engine. In this case a crankshaft flywheel stores energy when torque is exerted on it by a firing piston and returns it to the piston to compress a fresh charge of
