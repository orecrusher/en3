Early coal miners also worked close to the surface often in horizontal drift mines which meant that work was not as dangerous in the era before deep shaft mining. Most mining operations were far-flung enterprises away from urban centers which frustrated attempts to organize miners into a "critical mass" of collective power — even in the nation's most developed anthracite fields.

## Lesson Plan 
Mining. Mining is the process of extracting coal oil and natural gas from the ground. Strip mining (also known as open cast mountaintop or surface mining) involves scraping away earth and rocks to get to coal buried near the surface (Greenpeace 2010). This often has significant impact on the surrounding land plants and animals.

## Tennessee Coal Mining Railroading and Logging in 
Mining had been conducted as early as 1850 in Fentress County but the lack of suitable transportation to markets kept mining from commercializing until after 1900. The former method of extracting coal from the mines had been with tram motors that pulled bottom-dumping cars out of the mines.

## Mining 
Mining is a skill that allows players to obtain ores and gems from rocks. The higher a player's Mining level is the more likely they are to successfully extract ore. With ores a player can then either smelt bars and make equipment using the Smithing skill or sell them for profit. Mining is one of the most popular skills in RuneScape as many players try to earn a profit from the skill.

## Key Milestones in Coal Mining History 
These early methods were not efficient and it was not yet possible to dig up much coal from the Earth. But this was still a very significant step in the history of coal mining. Small scale shaft mining was first tried out and this would provide the prototype for future methods. Drift mining and belt pits were also commonly used to begin with.

## Early Methods and Technology 
And in the early years coal was mined entirely by hand. Miners usually worked in pairs to undercut pick-axe drill and blast the seams in order to break coal pieces free. During the 1880s mechanical coal cutters began to be introduced into some mines making the job a little easier and a lot more efficient.

Nowhere was the American system more dangerous than in early mining. In Britain coal seams were deep and coal expensive. As a result British mines used mining methods that recovered nearly all of the coal because they used waste rock to hold up the roof.

## PA Mining History
Early room-and-pillar mines did not include retreat mining; they relied on manual labor to cut the coal at the working face and the coal was hauled from the mine by horse and wagon. Today many room-and-pillar mines use mechanized continuous mining machines to cut the coal and a network of conveyors that transports the coal from the working face to the surface (continuous haulage).
