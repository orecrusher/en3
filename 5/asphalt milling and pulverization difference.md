## 3 Asphalt Processes To Know 
 · Pulverization involves a huge machine that drives on the roadway and rips off the existing asphalt. In contrast to milling pulverization uses the same asphalt to repave the area from which it is ripped. Pulverization results in several inches of asphalt residue spread across an area where the old asphalt used to be.

## Milling And Grinding 
The milling or grinding process is done on the already existing surface of the asphalt after mixing it and the previously underlying stone-base. This step is known as pulverization and it strengthens the existing base and forms a harder ground to work on.
