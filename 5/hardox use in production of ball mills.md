## Common Basic Formulas for Mineral Processing Calculations
 · Concentration and Recovery Formulas. These are used to compute the production of concentrate in a mill or in a particular circuit. The formulas are based on assays of samples and the results of the calculations are generally accurate— as accurate as the sampling assaying and crude ore (or other) tonnage on which they depend.

## A Review of Methods for Synthesis of Al Nanoparticles 
The objective of milling is to reduce the particle size and blending of particles in new phases. The different type of ball milling can be used for synthesis of nanomaterials in which balls impact upon the powder charge [12]. High-energy ball milling is a convenient way to produce nanosized powders.
