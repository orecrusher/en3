## Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide (VMS) Base Metal Deposits 
 · The main ore minerals in VMS deposits are sulphides including pyrite (iron sulphide) sphalerite (zinc sulphide) chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) and galena (lead sulphide). VMS deposits contain minor amounts of silver and gold plus a large variety of other elements including cobalt tin selenium manganese arsenic tellurium antimony and mercury among others.

## How is Silver Mined 
In Europe practically all Silver mined is extracted in the form of lead sulfide ore also known as Galena. Down under in Queensland Australia the Cannington mine is one of the world's largest in terms of reserves. In North America there are very few mines that extract Silver alone; most U.S. mines primarily dig for zinc lead and copper.

 · The ore used to extract silver was not a silver ore but Lead Sulphide (formula PbS) known as Galena or Galenite (named by the Roman Pliny) which contains 87% lead. The local variety of Galenite is silver-bearing and is known as Argentiferous Galenite (formula (Pb.Ag)S ) and the lead obtained from this ore contains just a small percentage of silver from 0.8% up to 5% (other sources

Gold and silver are obtained from a variety of ores. Most people think of nuggets and such but the truth is that very little comes from nuggets - nearly all newly mined gold comes from ores mined from the natural hard rocks that contain gold in tiny even microscopic particles.

 · Gold in some manganese-silver ores is amenable to direct cyanidation and its extraction is not increased by reduction. Gold in other ores follows the silver and is more or less refractory and is benefited as much as silver by reduction. Silver extraction of 60 per cent from raw ore may be increased to from 88 to 96 per cent.
