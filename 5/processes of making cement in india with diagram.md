This particular process represents some 16% of total production. Shale • Shale is a pure sedimentary rock made of very fine silt clay and quarz. Shale falls in the egory of mudstones.

## Cement Manufacturing Process 
Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium) sand and clay (silicon aluminum iron) shale fly ash mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.
