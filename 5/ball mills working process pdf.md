For any process including ball mill circuits we can say that output equals input multiplied by efficiency. Output = Input x Efficiency In a ball mill circuit the "output" can be defined as the production rate of fines of the circuit. As for any output ball mill circuit output is a function of both its inputs and efficiencies.
