## Gyratory Crusher Explained 
Cone Crushers; Typically the initial crushing stage is completed using either gyratory crushers or jaw crushers. It is often the case that there will be only one crusher installed and this will be referred to as the 'Primary Crusher'. Cone crushers are typically used for 2 nd 3 rd 4 th stage crushing steps (although not always).

A cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle which is covered by a wear-resistant mantle and the enclosing concave hopper covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner.
