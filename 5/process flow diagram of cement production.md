Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand clay fulfill the need of silicon iron and aluminum.

## Cement Manufacturing Process 
Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium) sand and clay (silicon aluminum iron) shale fly ash mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.
