## The cement mill 
In an open circuit system the feed rate of incoming clinker is adjusted to achieve the desired fineness of the product. In a closed circuit system coarse particles are separated from the finer product and returned for further grinding. Gypsum is interground with the clinker in order to control the setting properties of the cement.
