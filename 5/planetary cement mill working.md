## Ball Mill Critical Speed 
 · The critical speed of a rotating mill is the RPM at which a grinding medium will begin to "centrifuge" namely will start rotating with the mill and therefore cease to carry out useful work. Ball mills have been successfully run at speeds between 60 and 90 percent of critical speed but most mills operate at speeds between 65 and 79 percent of critical speed.

## Ball Mills 
The working principle is that cement is removed from the mill before over-grinding has taken place. The cement is then separated into a fine fraction which meets finished product requirements and a coarse fraction which is returned to mill inlet. Recirculation factor that is the ratio of mill throughput to fresh feed is up to three.
