Abstract This paper examines residential demand for electricity in Sri Lanka using survey data collected over a five-year period between 2011 and 2015. The study finds that the major determinants of demand for residential electricity are the result of price or market distortions (i.e. subsidies) socioeconomic variables and energy saving technology.

Finally the flat user has a rather consistent demand curve only using electricity during peak load 10% of the time. Say all three user types are charged using a flat rate tariff. As the peaky user increases their consumption during peak load the price of energy they use rises as well enough that this price sits above the tariff charged.
