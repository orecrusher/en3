## What is the difference between weathering and erosion?
Mechanical weathering is the process of breaking a large rock into smaller pieces without changing the minerals in the rock. Mechanical weathering may be caused by frost ice plant roots running water or heat from the sun. Once the small pieces of rocks are changed or broken apart by weathering they may start to be moved by wind water or ice.

## 4 Types and Examples of Chemical Weathering
 · Mechanical weathering occurs when water drips or flows over rock for prolonged periods; the Grand Canyon for example was formed to a large degree by the mechanical weathering action of the Colorado River. Chemical weathering occurs when water dissolves minerals in a rock producing new compounds. This reaction is called hydrolysis.

## Four Types of Physical Weathering 
 · When the rocks return to the ground under water they can hit other rocks and break apart. Water can also weather a rock by affecting the material around it. For instance clay that surrounds a rock can absorb water swell and then push against the rock causing it to break.

Therefore the potential for mechanical weathering is greater. Moving sand and silt acts like sandpaper on the larger rocks in the river bed. Also on each other. Rocks hitting other rocks can break. Making smaller pieces which can then become part of the suspended load. Rock falls. Usually break up when they hit bottom. Ice - the big one

 · Each move has a base acc percent. eg S-edge has an 80% chance of hitting at base acc. E-quake a 100% chance. double team and sand attack boost evaision and lower accuracy by 25% per use respectively. No Guard gives all moves <><> or infinite accuracy meaning all moves hit unless they are immune or use protect/detect.

## How Are River Rocks Formed? 
 · The formation of river rocks requires moving water and smaller rocks. Rocks easily eroded by water more likely form river rocks. Typical rocks with jagged edges can fall into the bottom of a river or stream bed or remain on the river bank. The speed of the river determines how quickly the rock becomes a river rock.
