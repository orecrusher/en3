 · Ore processing (or ore dressing) is the separation of iron ore from gangue in order to optimize the blast furnace process! In principle the undesirable gangue can never be completely separated from the iron ores during ore dressing. This means that a certain amount of unwanted elements always enters the blast furnace process.
