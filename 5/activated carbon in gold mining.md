 · The carbon has a very high affinity for the aurocyanide complex and adsorbs the gold out of solution resulting in very high loadings on the carbon (typically g/t). At the end of the leach the loaded carbon is removed from the slurry and the adsorbed gold is stripped out at high temperature and pressure with sodium hydroxide and cyanide solutions to form a high value electrolyte solution.

## ACTIVATED CARBON IN GOLD RECOVERY 
In the gold recovery industry activated carbon from a number of precursors has been used. Due to the nature of the in-pulp process the following characteristics are important: High affinity towards gold – kinetic activity and equilibrium loading. Hard resistant to abrasion.

 · Mining executives in these regions are acutely aware of the water issue. For instance Leagold Mining recently shut down its RDM gold mine in Brazil for two months because of drought conditions even though it had built a dam and a water pipeline. Even in areas with low water stress certain water-intensive mining processes are jeopardized.

## Activated Carbon for Gold Recovery 
Activated carbon has long been used as an adsorbent in the gold processing industry to recover gold from mining operations. Due to its high surface area and exceptional hardness coconut shell GAC (granulated activated carbon) is the main product used in carbon-in-leach (CIL) carbon-in-pulp (CIP) and carbon-in-column (CIC) operating systems.

## What is Activated Carbon and How is it Made?
 · Activated carbon is a processed porous version of carbon that has many different uses especially adsorption and chemical reaction needs for water and gas purifiion. Because activated carbon particles are so porous they have very expansive surface areas tucked into the holes and tunnels all over their surface.
