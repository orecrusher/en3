Aggregates are generally thought of as inert filler within a concrete mix. But a closer look reveals the major role and influence aggregate plays in the properties of both fresh and hardened concrete. Changes in gradation maximum size unit weight and moisture content can all alter the character and performance of your concrete mix.
