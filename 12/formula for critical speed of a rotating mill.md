Critical speed is the first resonant frequency (speed) of the rotating shaft. Resonance in a rotating shaft can be astrophic and even break the shaft. However not all ball screws will necessarily exhibit such behavior since the nut represents another support of the shaft permanently changing the unsupported length of the shaft and its resonant frequency.
