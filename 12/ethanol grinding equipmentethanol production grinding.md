## Ethanol Production and Manufacturing Process 
 · There are two production processes: wet milling and dry milling. In 2006 dry mill ethanol facilities accounted for 82% of US production and wet mills were 18%. The main difference between the two processes is in the initial treatment of the grain and the feed co-products. In the wet mill process instead of initially grinding the corn it is

## Ethanol Production 
Traditionally ethanol from corn has primarily been produced through dry- and wet-milling processes. The majority of U.S. ethanol production is from dry-grind technology. The traditional dry-grind process grinds the whole corn kernel and mixes it with water and enzymes. The mash is then cooked to liquefy the starch further.
