## Phosphate 
Phosphates. Phosphates are compounds containing the inorganic (PO4) 3− ion. Phosphates participate in forming the bones (endoskeletons) of higher life-forms as minerals in the apatite family with formulas of the form Ca5 (PO 4) 3X. The usual form is hydroxyapatite (X = OH) but Cl and F can also substitute for OH.
