## 11.23 Taconite Ore Processing 
Processing of taconite consists of crushing and grinding the ore to liberate iron-bearing particles concentrating the ore by separating the particles from the waste material (gangue) and pelletizing the iron ore concentrate. A simplified flow diagram of these processing steps is shown in Figure 11.23-1.

## OSTI.GOV Technical Report: Optimization of Comminution 
 · Abstract. The goal of this project was to improve energy efficiency of industrial crushing and grinding operations (comminution). Mathematical models of the comminution process were used to study methods for optimizing the product size distribution so that the amount of excessively fine material produced could be minimized.
