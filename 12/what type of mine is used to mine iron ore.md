 · The principal iron ores contain hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4). Hematite is an iron oxide mineral. It is non-magnetic and has colour variations ranging from steel silver to reddish brown. Pure hematite contains 69.9% Fe by molecular weight. It has been the dominant iron ore mined in Australia since the early 1960s.
