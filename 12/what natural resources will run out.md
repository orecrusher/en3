 · It seems we are running out of room on this planet of ours and before we know it we will be at maximum carrying capacity for the Earth. Probably the most serious of environmental problems we face as humans is overpopulation. People are in the frame of mind that if we run out of room in one town we can just simply spread out more.

## What if we ran out of minerals? 
Minerals make up most of what we use to build manufacture and stand on — including rocks and soil — so if we really ran out of minerals we'd all be scrambling for a spot on the planet's shrunken surface areas.. But if you were worried about running out of a single mineral important for industry then you probably can breathe easy. Most of the minerals we use a lot are very abundant.

## What if we ran out of fossil fuels? 
If we ran out of fossil fuels the relatively cheap and efficient alternative would likely be nuclear power. The danger surrounding fossil-fuel supplies has less to do with depleting them and more to do with what we can recover at a reasonable cost. Fossil fuels probably won't run out at least not in the sense that they will be exhausted.
