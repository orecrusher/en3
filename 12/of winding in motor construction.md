## DC Motor: Types Parts Construction Working Principle 
 · The construction of a DC shunt motor is similar to other types of DC motors as shown in the figure. This motor can consist of basic parts such as field windings (stator) a commutator and an armature (rotor). The working principle of a DC shunt motor is whenever a DC motor is turned ON suddenly DC flows across the entire stator as well as the

## 10. Starting Method for Induction Motors
10. Starting Method for Induction Motors A 3-phase induction motor is theoretically self starting. The stator of an induction motor consists of 3-phase windings which when connected to a 3-phase supply creates a rotating magnetic field. This will link and cut the rotor conductors which in turn will induce a current in the rotor conductors and
