## Managing Effects of Earthworks 
Activity status usually varies depending on the loion and scale of soil disturbance associated with earthworks. For example large-scale earthworks and earthworks loed in close proximity to sensitive receiving waters should have a more restrictive activity status due to the greater potential to generate adverse effects from the discharge of sediment.

 · Soil quality and the changes in soil quality that occur with soil management can be expected to affect natural resource models. For example consider the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model (Laflen et al. 1991ab) in which soil quality is assumed to affect both the water infiltration and the soil erosion portions of the model.
