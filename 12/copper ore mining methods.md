## Mining Method 
The most viable way to recover the ore body is by a well-established underground mining method called block caving. Block caving is safe environmentally sound and cost-effective for mining a large deep orebody. In block caving a large section of ore is initially undercut by drilling and blasting causing it to collapse under its weight.

## Mining and Mineral Use 
Copper is mined and extracted from copper ores. To extract the metal from the ore the rock is melted at a temperature greater than 900°C which requires a lot of energy. Extracting metal from rock is so energy intensive that if you recycle just 40 aluminum cans you will save the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline.
