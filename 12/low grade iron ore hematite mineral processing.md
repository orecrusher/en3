 · The low grade of the iron ore where the Fe grade is less than 60% could be upgraded possibly by crushing grinding washing classifying jiggling and de-s (Pal et al. 2010). Moreover a number of quartz and kaolinite particles appear to be coated by goethite so de-s and scrubbing processes could be conducted to remove the impurities ( Somprasong and Meechamna 2009 ).

 · Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging. Iron ore resources are getting consumed at an accelerated rate because of the growth in the production of iron and steel. Due to this reason the availability of high grade iron ore is reducing and the supply of high grade iron ore to iron and steel plants is declining sharply.
