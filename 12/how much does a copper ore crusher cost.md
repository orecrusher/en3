In many ores (and most of those found in the Western USA) the copper minerals occur as a dispersion of fine particles. Such ores are called porphyriesWhere mineralized rocks become outcropped or shattered the sulfide minerals undergo chemical changes due to air groundwater and heat giving rise to the other main variety of copper minerals - the oxidized ores.

 · Successful copper mining requires concentrated ore which can be ground into fine material. The copper is then separated from waste materials and is then refined further through the smelting process. Although copper has been used by humans for many centuries more than 95% of all the copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted after 1900.

Crushed ore is ball or rod-milled in large rotating cylindrical machines until it becomes a powder usually containing less than 1 percent copper. Sulfide ores are moved to a concentrating stage while oxide ores are routed to leaching tanks. 3. Concentrating Minerals are concentrated into a slurry that is about 15% copper. Waste slag is removed.
