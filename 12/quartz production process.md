## How Does Quartz Form? 
What is Quartz? Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in the Earth's crust. It comes in many different varieties. Amethyst citrine and agate are just a few popular gem forms of quartz.. In the most basic sense quartz is the crystalline form of silicon dioxide. When quartz grows into large crystals lapidaries can cut varieties such as rock crystal smoky quartz amethyst or citrine.

## Making of fused quartz and fused silica 
Historically the first method of producing fused quartz was by small-scale fusion of quartz crystals in a flame. Heraeus chemist Richard Küch first began fusing quartz rock crystal in a hydrogen/oxygen (H2/O2) flame more than 100 years ago. Heraeus has been producing quartz glass on an industrial scale with this process ever since.
