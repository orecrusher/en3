## Screw Conveyor Capacity 
A 16-inch diameter screw conveyor will convey 2496 cubic feet per hour at the maximum recommended speed of 80-rpm. The actual screw conveyor speed is calculated by dividing the Selection Capacity by the capacity at 1-rpm. 1873/31.2 = 60-rpm. 60-rpm is the correct speed for a 16-inch diameter screw conveyor with cut and folded flights and

Trough ends are dust-tight with bearings suitable both for radial and axial loads; longer screw conveyors are equipped with intermediate hanger bearings in order to minimise shaft deflection. The design and selection of materials for the screw conveyor are adapted depending on the properties of the conveyed product (abrasiveness bulk density size moisture chemical properties etc.).

In order to make the screw shaft in a more favorable tension state we usually place the drive device and the discharge port at the same end of the conveyor and the feed port at another end. Besides the spiral shaft is equipped with the thrust bearing at the end of the material movement direction and when the machine body is long we will add a hanger bearing on the equipment.
