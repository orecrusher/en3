 · They are fine non-crystalline molecules of SiO2. The mineral composition of Silica (SiO2) is a mixture of Silicon and Oxygen. They can be available on Earth Crust or can be mined for the extraction of pure silica sand. The extracted ore undergoes processing for the removal of impurities to obtain the purest form of silica sand.

## Silica 
Silica. Also called silica sand or quartz sand silica is silicon dioxide (SiO 2). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful easy to mine and relatively easy to process it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock quartzite is another source.
