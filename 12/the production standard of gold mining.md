## How Gold Is Mined 
The lifecycle of a gold mine. People in hard hats working underground is what often comes to mind when thinking about how gold is mined. Yet mining the ore is just one stage in a long and complex gold mining process. Long before any gold can be extracted significant exploration and development needs to take place both to determine as accurately as possible the size of the deposit as well
