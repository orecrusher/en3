The gold-bearing cyanide solution is then concentrated and the gold is recovered and further purified if gold ore contains mercury air emissions from ore processing may occur under certain physical and chemical conditions.

In regard to gold mining reef gold as distinct from alluvial deposits was typically found as a mineral in an ore body sometimes in combination with other minerals such as silver lead copper and iron pyrites. Stampers were generally in demise by the 1890s as gold from the mill was being lost through the use of stamper technology.

Gold and silver are obtained from a variety of ores. Most people think of nuggets and such but the truth is that very little comes from nuggets - nearly all newly mined gold comes from ores mined from the natural hard rocks that contain gold in tiny even microscopic particles.

Once the ore has been broken up into fine dust testing for free gold content in hardrock ore can be done using some type of gravity method. A simple gold pan can be used to sample small amounts of crushed ore or if a decent water supply is available then it can be run through many types of separation devices. Shaker tables are commonly used and although quite expensive work exceedingly

## Gold processing 101 
 · Metallurgical processing of metalliferous ores in general and gold ores in particular consists essentially of three stages often colloquially referred to as: Bashing (crushing); Mashing (grinding); and. Hashing (extraction/recovery) In the context of flowsheet selection the bashing and mashing stages are relatively straightforward.

## Design of a crushing system that improves the crushing 
The gold ores are usually big and. have to be crushed to reduce them to a size of about 12mm diameter before pure gold can be extracted from them. The ore usually has to pass various crushing stages each reducing the ore to a certain size. Crushing plant layout is of vital importance. Gold-containing rocks are crushed for several reasons
