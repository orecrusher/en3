Natural sands such as river sand marine sand quarry dust and dune sand have their own drawbacks. For instance marine sand has a high percentage of salt [19-21]; quarry sand has a large amount of fines/dust; and because of the loosely packed soil particles dune sand is unfit to be used in concrete.

Natural Processess. Coastal lands and sediments are constantly in motion. Breaking waves move sand along the coast eroding sand in one area and depositing it on an adjacent beach. Tidal cycles bring sand onto the beach and carry it back into the surf. Rivers carry sediment to the coast and build deltas into the open water.
