## Mining and Refining – Energy Efficiency 
Aluminium is an "energy bank"; most of the original input can be recovered every time the product is recycled. Bauxite mining requires relatively low energy inputs compared to other steps in the aluminium production process – with less than 1.5 kilograms of fuel oil (mainly in the form of diesel for haul trucks) and less than 5 kWh of electricity consumed per tonne of bauxite extracted.

Bauxite mining. Aluminium doesn't occur as a isolated ore (it's too reactive with other compounds) but as one combined with other minerals chief of which is bauxite. Bauxite is mined from open mines from loions mainly in a wide belt around the equator. Bauxite is a mixture of aluminium hydroxide iron oxide titanium dioxide and kaolinite.
