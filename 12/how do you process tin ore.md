## Lead and Zinc Smelting 
allurgical process ore concentrate containing lead zinc or both is fed in some cases after sin-tering into a primary smelter. Lead concentra-tions can be 50–70% and the sulfur content of sulfidic ores is in the range of 15–20%. Zinc con-centration is in the range of 40–60% with sulfur content in sulfidic ores in the range of 26–34%.

## What to do with Ore's : blackdesertonline
You just might have to wait a little for the iron ingots to sell if you priced them appropriately. I do the same with Tin and Copper. I don't turn them into Bronze because Tin Ingots and Copper Ingots are worth more than combining them.

## Tin ore separation process 
Tin ore separation process The density of tin ore is bigger than paragenetic mineral so we use gravity concentration to processing tin oreBecause there are many oxide iron ore inside for example : magnetite hematite if use gravity concentration or flotation that could not separate them from tin so magnetic will be added .

## Extracting Gold 
To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces.

## Metallic Deposits 
Metallic ores occur in every kind of rock and some varieties of soil. The metallic minerals are concentrated into rich masses by igneous hydrothermal or erosional/weathering processes. Metals such as chromium platinum nickel copper and iron can precipitate as sulfide minerals in
