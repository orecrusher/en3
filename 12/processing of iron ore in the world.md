DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state i.e. without melting as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen coming from reformed natural gas syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

In the DRI process iron ore in the form of lump or pellets is reduced to metallic iron in the solid state unlike in the BF where the material is melted. Today about 100 Mt of DRI is produced globally each year with the majority of that using reformed natural gas (essentially splitting natural gas into hydrogen and carbon monoxide) to strip away the oxygen from the iron ore.

Iron ore is a natural material that is mined all around the world. Iron ore fines are created as a result of mining crushing and processing the larger pieces of ore. Iron ore fines are less desirable (and of lower value) as they need to be sintered before they can be utilised otherwise it will effectively smother the air flow in the blast furnace.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
