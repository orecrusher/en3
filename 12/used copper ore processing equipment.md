The process can be used on ores that are only 0.5 to one percent copper too little for conventional refining. The solution is then drained in to an electrolytic cell and copper extracted from it. In addition studies show that zinc nickel and cobalt can also largely be extracted by the process of bioleaching (Rawlings Douglas and Johnson 2007).
