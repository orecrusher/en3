Our mix-on-site concrete calculation is based on batching by volume (Large construction sites employ batching by weight which is more exact). You can also estimate the quantity of sand and gravel required by weight; Simply multiply the volumetric quantity of sand and gravel with 1400 kg/m 3 (bulk density of sand) and 1600 kg/m 3 (bulk density of stone) respectively when calculating in metric
