Tin ores that contain high sulphide mineral contents have to undergo an additional process whereby the ore is baked at °C to burn the sulphur. Flotation is not as efficient for tin as it is for sulphide ores it is becoming more frequently used to improve the amount of tin recovered from both primary ores and reprocessing to recover tin from processed waste material.

 · Tin occurs in cassiterite ore bodies and breaking down these ore bodies to extract the metal expends energy. Producing tin requires ample supplies of coal electricity and crude oil. Mines and blast furnaces utilize energy to extract tin ores from the ground and process it into tin. These costs can have a big effect on primary production.
