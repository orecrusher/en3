## Crushers 
Cone crushers resemble gyratory crushers from technological standpoint but unlike gyratory crushers cone crushers are popular in secondary tertiary and quaternary crushing stages. Sometimes however the grain size of the processed material is small enough by nature and the traditional primary crushing stage is not needed.

## TECHNICAL NOTES 5 CRUSHERS 
The chief difference between cone and gyratory or jaw crushers is the nearly parallel arrangement of the mantle and the cone at the discharge end in the cone crusher. This is illustrated in Figure 5.2. Reduction ratios in the following ranges are common for cone crushers: 6:1 - 8:1 for secondaries 4:1 - 6:1 for tertiary and quaternary crushing.

## Cone Crushers 
Cone Crushers. A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel. Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point.

## Types of Rock Crushers 
Cone crushers are built with a rotating mantle in a concave bowl lined with manganese—this is similar to gyratory crushers but the crushing chamber in cone crushers is not as steeply angled. Cone crushers can accept medium-hard to very hard and abrasive feeds that might be dry or wet though not sticky (whereas gyratory crushers are better at handling softer dryer feeds).

## Gyratory Crushers 
 · Gyratory Crushers. The primary rock breaker most commonly used in large plants is the gyratory crusher of which a typical section is shown in Fig. 5. It consists essentially of a gyrating crushing head (521) working inside a crushing bowl (522) which is fixed to the frame (501).

## Cone Crusher 
Cone crushers were originally designed and developed by around 1920 and therefore are often described as cone crushers. As the mechanisms of crushing in these crushers are similar to gyratory crushers their designs are similar but in this case the spindle is supported at the bottom of the gyrating cone instead of being suspended as in larger gyratory crushers.
