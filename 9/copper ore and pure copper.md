## Copper pyrites is an ore of copper. (i) Describe the 
Copper pyrites are concentrated by froth flotation process. In this process slurry of finely divided ore is taken in a large tank. Pine oil or eucalyptus oil is used as the frothing agent. Ethyl xanthate is added which is used as a collector (it increases the binding force between ore particles and forth). A mixture of all these things is agitated by current of air and froth is formed.

 · Real copper is fairly dense measuring at 8.96 g/cm3. Weigh the object then divide by the object's volume to figure out its density. Is the density the same or very close to the density of copper? Then the object is made of copper. If the number is very different the object might contain some copper but is not pure copper.

## Extraction of Copper from Copper pyrite 
The principal ore of copper is copper pyrite and copper is extracted from this ore. The different steps in extraction of copper are: Crushing and Concentration: The ore obtained from mines are broken down into small piece by jaw crusher and then pulverized. The ore being sulphide ore is concentrated by froth floatation process.
