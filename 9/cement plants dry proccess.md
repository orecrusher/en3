## how cement is made dry process technology
Cement Wikipedia. Dry process. 1 Mixing of raw material in a dry state in blenders. 2 The dry materials exiting the mill are called "kiln feed". 3 Size of the kiln needed for the manufacturing of cement is smaller. 4 Difficult to control mixing of Raw materials so it is difficult to obtain a better homogeneous material.
