 · Mercury has been used in the extraction of gold in mining as it can extract gold from low grade ore. But the recovery process involves distilling off the mercury which is dangerous and polluting. Chemists used to work with mercury a lot and when they did they were recommended to remove their wedding rings or other gold jewellery as the mercury would damage the gold.

## Selective Removal of Mercury from Gold Bearing Streams 
In modern gold mining processes typically it is necessary to extract gold from complex ores which comprise gold in addition to other metals including mercury. A common technique for extracting gold from its ores is the cyanide process wherein leaching of gold is achieved by the addition of cyanide at alkaline pH following the Elsner equation ( Equation (i) ) ( 1 ).

## Mercury
Small-scale gold mining is the largest anthropogenic contributor of mercury pollution on planet Earth. The miners grind gold ore together with mercury in order to recover the fine gold grains. The gold amalgam is burned whereby the mercury evaporates and gold is left behind. This processing extracts only a fraction of the gold in the ore and the released mercury causes serious global health

## Mercury Amalgamation and Fine Gold Recovery 
 · In the 1800's the use of mercury to extract gold from ore (called Amalgamation) was the most commonly used method by small scale prospectors for this purpose. It has been a highly controversial method of extraction to say the least because of both the physical and environmental health risks that mercury poses.

## Mercury Usage in Gold Mining and Why It Is a Problem
 · The principle of gold extraction by using mercury (amalgamation method) is mainly that after the mercury is added to the slurry the surface of the gold particles is wetted by mercury and then the mercury diffuses into the interior of the gold particles causing a chemical reaction. Au+2Hg=AuHg2. Finally the solid of Au3 Hg will form.
