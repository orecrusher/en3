## Cooling water pump 
Cooling water pumps are used for supplying heat exchangers with cooling water. Their flow rate varies depending on the heat flow to be dissipated. The required head is determined by the type of cooling system. A distinction is made between wet cooling and dry cooling processes. Range of head and flow rate The required heads for fresh water operation usually lie within 5 to 15 m. In cooling

This cooler water absorbs heat from the engine to help keep it cool. Most newer marine engines use an enclosed cooling system. This means that there is a small tank on the top of the engine that

## How to size your boat 
The general rule of thumb for sizing a pleasure boat is using the formula of 14BTU's/cubic foot (480 BTUs/cubic meter) of air conditioned space. This factor is for typically constructed pleasure boats and should be adjusted if non-standard construction techniques have been employed. It is prudent to use a factor of 16 to 19 BTU's/cubic foot

## Reactor Coolant Pump 
 · Reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) are used to pump primary coolant around the primary circuit. The purpose of the reactor coolant pump is to provide forced primary coolant flow to remove and transfer the amount of heat generated in the reactor core. There are many designs of these pumps and there are many designs of primary coolant loops.
