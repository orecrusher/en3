## Jet mill working principle 
Jet mills operate in compressed air gas or high pressure superheated steam. Jet mills have no moving parts thereby eliminating contamination due to contact with external grinding media. It is also an ideal process to grind heat-sensitive and waxy material because no attritional heat is generated. Jet mill works on fluid energy.

## Energy Use of Fine Grinding in Mineral Processing 
 · Fine grinding to P80 sizes as low as 7 μm is becoming increasingly important as mines treat ores with smaller liberation sizes.This grinding is typically done using stirred mills such as the Isamill or Stirred Media Detritor. While fine grinding consumes less energy than primary grinding it can still account for a substantial part of a mill's energy budget.
