 · Step 2 - Steel making The steel making process is shown in Figure 2. Vanadium recovery Before conversion into steel vanadium is recovered from the molten iron. This is done firstly because of the value of the vanadium rich slag produced (15% vanadium as V2O5) and secondly because a high vanadium content can make the steel too hard.

## 1A Manufacturing Process for Iron and Steel
The figure shows a flowchart of the integrated manufacturing process for iron and steel using the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace (denoted BF and BOF hereinafter respectively) which is presently the most commonly used method (51% of world steel production). After the BF-BOF process molten steel is controlled to a target composition and temperature and is then cast by continuous casting

## INTRODUCTION TO SHEET METAL FORMING PROCESSES
metal forming operation can always be from the conceptual point of view divided in two stages: • A first stage where the volume of the part is generated • A second stage where the geometrical details are formed (reverse drawing) In the first stage deformation and material flow are mostly controlled by run-offs (die addendum or dieface).

## Flow Drill Tap 
Flow drilling (also called; flow forming or friction drilling) is a thermal process for producing a bush from the parent metal. In flow drilling and tapping a rapidly rotating cone-shaped 'drill' point is brought into contact with the material surface. As pressure is applied heat is generated through friction.
