## Critical speed 
Critical speed depends upon the magnitude and loion of the shaft unbalance the length of the shaft its diameter and the kind of bearing support. Many practical appliions suggest as good practice that the maximum operating speed should not exceed 75% of the critical speed; however there are cases that require speeds above the critical speed to work correctly.

The "Critical Speed" for a grinding mill is defined as the rotational speed where centrifugal forces equal gravitational forces at the mill shell's inside surface. This is the rotational speed where balls will not fall away from the mill's shell. Result #1: This mill would need to spin at RPM to be at 100% critical speed. Result #2: This mill's

 · Critical Velocity Formula [ Minimum velocity at the highest point of the vertical circle] | √(gr) formula. Critical velocity formula is expressed as V1 = √(gr) where g is the acceleration due to gravity and r is the radius of the vertical circular path being traversed by the object. So the minimum velocity needed at the highest point to complete a vertical circle is expressed as √(gr)

## Mill Critical Speed Calculation
 · The mill was rotated at 63% of the critical speed. The position of the balls at the end of five revolutions is shown in Figure 2. It is seen that using a low coefficient of friction at the walls balls tend to flow down the surface of the charge and a "toe" begins to form. As the friction at the wall increases aracting motion is observed.
