## Impact of weathering on rock material strengths of granite
A total of 298 geomechanical strength tests were conducted for fresh as well as slightly weathered rock material employing the uniaxial compressive strength test and Brazilan tensile strength test. Statistical analysis of the results at 95 percent confidence level exhibited that the means of compressive strength for fresh and slightly weathered granites were 113.6±7.0 MPa and 68.9±3.6 MPa.
