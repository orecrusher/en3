SEGREGATED ORE FEED CONTROL (Feed Ratio Optimisation) On milling plants fed by a segregated feed supply such as a stockpile the varying size and hardness of the mill feed material affects the residence time in the mill and the power drawn. When the load becomes critically high the feed needs to be cut in order to "grind the mill out".

## Ball Mills 
Ball mills are filled up to 40% with steel balls (with 30–80 mm diameter) which effectively grind the ore. The material that is to be ground fills the voids between the balls. The tumbling balls capture the particles in ball/ball or ball/liner events and load them to the point of fracture.
