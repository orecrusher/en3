 · Milling machines can be used in both horizontal and vertical orientations and many can perform multi-axis machining. The tool head of a milling machine can be swapped out for a number of different types depending on what needs to be accomplished. Some common tool heads include ball end mills rounding mills fluted mills and standard cutters.

## Climb Milling vs. Conventional Milling 
 · Climb Milling vs. Conventional Milling. There are two distinct ways to cut materials when milling: Conventional Milling (Up) and Climb Milling (Down). The difference between these two techniques is the relationship of the rotation of the cutter to the direction of feed. In Conventional Milling the cutter rotates against the direction of the feed.
