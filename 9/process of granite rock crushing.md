## What is Crushed Aggregate? (with pictures)
Crushed aggregate is produced in quarries by processing larger rocks into smaller pieces. Crushed aggregate also known as rock aggregate refers to a crushed stone product produced in quarries. In areas where natural sand and gravel aggregate deposits are insufficient to handle local demand larger stones are processed in an impact crusher to create crushed rock aggregate.
