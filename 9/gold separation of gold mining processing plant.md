## Woodlark Gold Project 
 · Waste rock from the mine will be sent to a single dump loed adjacent to each open-pit. The crushed ore will pass through a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) circuit ball milling followed by gravity separation. A conventional carbon-in-leach (CIL) processing plant with a capacity of 2.4Mtpa will then adsorb gold and silver onto carbon.
