## Improvements to machining surface quality by controlling 
 · Electrochemical milling is eminently suitable for machining aerospace parts (which usually have complex structures) because of its great flexibility. However titanium alloys are particularly sensitive to changes in the flow field which often cause severe pitting corrosion of the machined surface. Although electrochemical sinking and milling (ESM) can restrict the flow of electrolyte and

## Machining accuracy improvement in five
 · 1.. IntroductionFive-axis machining has received much attention in both industry and the research community since 1980s. With two extra rotational degrees of freedom it offers numerous advantages over three-axis machining such as higher production rate and fewer setups and thus is widely used in the manufacture of complex geometries like turbine blade impeller and molds.

5-axis machining is different from 3+2-axis machining. 5-axis CNC milling or machining involves continuous adjustments of the cutting tool along all five axes to keep the tooltip optimally perpendicular to the part. While 3+2 machining also known as 5-sided machining or 5-axis indexed it's actually a 3-axis program with the cutting tool
