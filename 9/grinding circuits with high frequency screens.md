## HRC high pressure grinding rolls 
The HRC is best suited for crushing in high-tonnage hard rock appliions. Common circuits utilize high pressure grinding rolls in a number of ways: The HRC is ideal for crushing hard rock with relatively low moisture content and can provide superior results in the size reduction of a variety of minerals.

## Ore Processing Challenges in Gold Operation Grinding Circuits
 · Over-grinding does not have a significant benefit to gold recovery but reduces the mill throughput and results in higher unit costs in terms of energy grinding media and reagent consumption. If there are frequent changes in ore hardness grinding circuit performance is affected and poses challenges for operators to maintain the target particle size.

Its use is efficient in differential mode balanced circuits and has low efficiency in low frequencies on unbalanced circuits. In high frequency circuits with grounded multipoints the efficiency is high since the return current tends to flow through the adjacent return. However in common mode high frequencies the cable has little efficiency.
