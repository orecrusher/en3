## Gypsum as an Agricultural Amendment: General Use Guidelines
Existing uses of FGD gypsum will be unable to consume all of the new FGD gypsum that will be created. Because it is well known that mined gypsum can improve soil properties and water management and can enhance agricultural produc-tion there is great interest in using the high-quality FGD gypsum produced by utilities in place of mined gypsum.

## Toxic chemicals used in mining 
Toxic chemicals are used in the Flotation Process to separate the copper and molybdenum out of the milled powder. This Flotation process is the major extraction method at Duval/Sierrita mine because of the poor quality of the copper at this site. Some chemicals produce bubbles that that the copper adheres to and the "bad stuff" falls to the bottom.
