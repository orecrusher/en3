## coal processing for power production
Thermal-based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources. The coal-fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption. Coal fired power plants while producing power require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2.
