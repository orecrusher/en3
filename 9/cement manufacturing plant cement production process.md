Cement plants are usually built near the quarry of limestone so the quarried limestone can be transported to the cement plant directly by belt conveyor or other conveying systems. If the distance between the quarry and the cement plant is too long to use conveyors the limestones will have to be transported by trucks which means higher transportation fees and inconvenience.

## Cement: Materials and manufacturing process
• Chalk is porous and often has high moisture content that leads it to its use in the 'semi-dry/wet' manufacturing process of making cement. This particular process represents some 16% of total production. Shale • Shale is a pure sedimentary rock made of very fine silt clay and quarz. Shale falls in the egory of mudstones.
