Following the South African War population patterns resumed their previous trends of rapid growth assisted in part by the influx in 1904 of some 64000 Chinese indentured labourers. Following their repatriation in 1910 they were replaced on the mines by the introduction of migrant Black labour much of it recruited from neighbouring territories.

 · The gold cyanide complex is then extracted from the pulp or slurry by adsorption onto activated carbon. CIL stands for carbon-in-leach. This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to the leach tanks (or reaction vessel) so that leaching and adsorption take place in the same tanks.

## Discuss Gold mining in South Africaprocessing 
Gold in S. Africa Gold occurs as small grains in a hard rock. It's mined by shaft mining since its bearing rocks are deep below the surface. The main mining area is the Witwatersrand and others are Ogendaalrus and lydenburg. Processing - Ore is crushed to a fine powdery dust. - Mixed with water until it is fluid mud. - Cyanide is added to
