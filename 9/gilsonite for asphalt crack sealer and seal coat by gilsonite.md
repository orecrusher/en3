## STAR
Do not apply over surfaces sealed with gilsonite and other solvent based seal coatings. New asphalt pavements must be allowed to cure at least 90 days in hot weather. Perform a water break free test to confirm that the surface oils have dissipated by spreading water on the pavement. If the water does not bead pavement is ready for seal-coating.

## Gilsonite Uses 
Gilsonite functions by making the pavements harder stronger and increases asphalt's adhesion to aggregates. It is generally regarded that Gilsonite reduces pavements' low temperature properties making them susceptible to thermal cracking. Gilsonite melted into hot asphalt will reduce penetration and increase viscosity of the asphalt binder.

## Denn's Sealcoating 
Oil-Based Sealant Oil base sealer is too hard and asphalt will become brittle and crack. The solvent dissolves and breaks down the asphalt binder. The Gilsonite wears away within a year and weakens the binder which will lead to cracks. The original binder would have would have been stronger if you didn't even seal it in the first place.
