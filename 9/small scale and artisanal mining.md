## Artisanal and Small Scale Mining 
 · Artisanal and Small Scale Mining (ASM) is one of the oldest forms of income generation in mineral rich developing countries. Traditionally identified as low capital-high labour intensive and employing rudimentary equipment and mining techniques ASM is most significantly distinguished from industrial mining by poor safety health and environment conditions as well as low levels of production.
