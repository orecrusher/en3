## "Determination of the Gas Content of Coal" by Abouna Saghafi
In coal mining the gas content of coal is required primarily to quantify the gassiness of coal for safe mining but also to quantify potential greenhouse gas emissions from mining. In Australia the gas content of coal is determined using a direct method whereby the gas desorbed from solid or crushed coal is collected and the volume and composition of the desorbed gas are measured.
