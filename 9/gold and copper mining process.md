## What is biomining? 
Biomining is mineral processing with microbes. Biomining is the process of using microorganisms (microbes) to extract metals of economic interest from rock ores or mine waste. Biomining techniques may also be used to clean up sites that have been polluted with metals. Valuable metals are commonly bound up in solid minerals. Some microbes can oxidize those metals allowing them

Gold and silver are products of the copper mining and smelting process. They follow the same production pathway as our copper ore from the mine to the smelter. At the refinery we lower copper anodes (which contain gold and silver) into an acid solution. Gold and silver drop off into the bottom of the tank as electrolytic slimes.

## Geology of Copper 
 · How Copper is Mined. Copper is found alongside many other types of ore. It can be found near gold silver zinc lead and other types of metal deposits. When mixed in with other ores copper is not usually found in great abundance. Until the development of the modern copper mining process it was typically a byproduct of mining for other metals.
