## Use of Coal Waste as Fine Aggregates in Concrete Paving Blocks
The aim of this work was to study the use of coal waste to produce concrete paving blocks. The methodology considered the following steps: sampling of a coal mining waste; gravity separation of the fraction with specific gravity between 2.4 and 2.8; comminution of the material and particle size analysis; technological characterization of the material and the production of concrete paving blocks.
