## Pollution from Mining 
Mining provides essential raw materials for an industrialized society. However it causes serious pollution of surface and groundwater. Transferring minerals from deep below the surface to the surface promotes oxidation reactions. Oxidation of iron salts and of sulfur-containing materials in the presence of water leads to highly acidic solutions.

## How do we extract minerals? 
Lower grade metal ores found closer to the surface can be profitably mined using surface mining methods which generally cost less than underground methods. Many industrial minerals are also mined this way as these ores are usually low in value and were deposited at or near the Earth's surface.
