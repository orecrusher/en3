In the case of copper it is worth extracting when there is about 2 kg of copper per 1000 kg of ore (0.2%). Copper minerals are found in over one hundred varieties although only a few have been worked for copper on a large scale. The most abundant ores are chalcopyrite and bornite which contain both copper and iron sulphides.

## Mineral Deposit Value 
Before you can calculate the potential mineral deposit value you first need to gather some specific data regarding the ore body and the individual drill results.. This required data can be found in the mining company's press releases in which they announce their drill results.Make sure that this data is announced according to the guidelines of National Instrument 43-101 (i.e. approved by a

## Copper Smelting Process 
 · Introduction to Copper Smelting Techniques. Copper ore typically contains only about 0.6% of the actual copper mineral the most common ore mined being chalcopyrite. The ore is attained using traditional methods of underground and open pit mining the later accounting for 90% of the ore used in smelting.

## Copper extraction from chalcopyrite: Comparison of three 
 · Copper extractions from ore exceeded those obtained during chalcopyrite concentrate leaching but that would be due partly to the finer particle size distribution of the milled ore. Nevertheless the stable pH and ORP during leaching with lower KNO 3 concentration ( Fig. 6 a) afford the opportunity to optimise the system at even lower nitrate concentrations and slightly higher solution pH.
