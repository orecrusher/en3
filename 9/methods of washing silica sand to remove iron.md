Washing with low-pressure or medium-pressure water is probably one of the most commonly used methods for removing dirt or other pollutant soiling from historic masonry buildings. Starting with a very low pressure (100 psi or below) even using a garden hose and progressing as needed to slightly higher pressure—generally no higher than psi—is always the recommended way to begin.

## Characterization and Beneficiation of the Glass Making 
grams of material can eliminate silica sand from glass making. Thus raw materials are usually processed to remove minerals that contain contaminants (Schurlz and Kohl 1991; Zdunczyk 1994; Goldman 1994). The most common and easiest processing technique is simple washing. Water is added to the sand then the slurry is pumped to a cyclone separator.
