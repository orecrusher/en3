## How electricity is generated and transmitted? 
 · Electricity generated at power stations uses the same principle as the electricity produced by a bicycle dynamo that is electromagnetic induction. The huge generator at a power station is also known as an alternator. The electromagnets (the rotor) are rotated by turbines while the coils and iron core (the stator) are at rest.

## Wind power 
Wind power or wind energy is the use of wind to provide mechanical power through wind turbines to turn electric generators for electrical power.Wind power is a popular sustainable renewable energy source that has a much smaller impact on the environment compared to burning fossil fuels.. Wind farms consist of many individual wind turbines which are connected to the electric power

## How is Electricity Made? (with pictures) 
Electricity is made when a turbine moves a large magnet around a very large wire. This movement serves to electrify the wire. The energy is then pushed away from the generator through special transformers. Nuclear power plants use nuclear fusion to heat water into steam that drives electricity-producing turbines.
