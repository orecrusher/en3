Workholding is the generic term for any device used to firmly hold your workpiece while machining it. Closely related terms are "jigs" and "fixtures.". A fixture holds your workpiece while it is being cut. A jig holds the workpiece and also guides the cutter. Given CNC there's little need for jigs as the g-code guides the cutter so

4 Methods for Creating Channels in Part Design Use these even solids; we often see them in parts for medical devices. Channels are formed in injection-molded plastic parts with cores or pins projecting from a mold half or cam. At Protolabs these pins can be milled out of the mold block or a more robust steel pin can be inserted after milling.

## Channel Planning Best Practices 
 · Specifically devices perform a Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) by listening to see if another device is actively transmitting on the channel before attempting to send its own frames. When a device detects another transmission in progress it will perform a random back-off for a short period of time after which it would perform another check before attempting to transmit again.
