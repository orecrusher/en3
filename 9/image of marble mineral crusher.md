## Types of marble 
Marble is a rock made of calcium carbonate which has been exposed to a natural recrystallization process.. Marble is being created by the transformation of other stones through the action of high temperatures and intense pressures. As a result of this process new minerals textures and structures give rise to a large number of different types of marble as we will see in the examples below.

Precipitated Calcium Carbonate. PCC stands for Precipitated Calcium Carbonate—also known as purified refined or synthetic calcium carbonate. It has the same chemical formula as other types of calcium carbonate such as limestone marble and chalk: CaCO3. The calcium carbon and oxygen atoms can arrange themselves in three different ways to form three different calcium carbonate minerals.
