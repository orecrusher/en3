## A STUDY ON THE USE OF CRUSHED STONE AGGREGATE AND CRUSHER 
Crushed stone aggregate was obtained from nearby stone crusher plants of Visakhapatnam. After brushing the aggregate it was washed and dried. A set of sieves such as 53mm 26.5mm 9.5mm etc. have identified for the gradation of stone aggregate and for the fine aggregate 4.75mm 2.36mm 0.425mm 0.075mm sizes were identified. Various percentages of

## Crushed rock sand – An economical and ecological 
 · Crushed rock sand has surfaced as a viable alternative to Natural River sand and is being now used commonly throughout the world as fine aggregate in concrete. It is manufactured by crushing the quarried stone to a size that will completely pass through 4.75 mm sieve.

## Studies on Pumice Lightweight Aggregate Concrete with 
The lightweight aggregate is an aggregate that weighs less than the usual rock aggregate and the quarry dust is a rock particle used in the concrete for the experimentation. The significant intention of the proposed technique is to frame a mathematical modeling with the aid of the optimization techniques. The mathematical modeling is done by minimizing the cost and time consumed in the case of
