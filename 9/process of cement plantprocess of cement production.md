## Cement kiln 
Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica-bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silies.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant.

## How Cement Is Made 
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

## Cement production and cooling 
 · During the cement production process these minerals are fused together by heating them to just under their melting point forming a cement clinker between 3 to 20 mm in diameter. Pure cement is formed when the cement clinker is ground into a fine powder. To regulate how cement mortar or concrete will set gypsum is added to this powder.

## Cement Plant 
The original process at the Ramla cement plant to produce cement from limestone which is the base material of cement was a so-called wet line process. The original wet line had a capacity of 1800 TPD (Tons Per Day). The first new production line producing cement through a so-called dry line process was commissioned in 1994.

The cement plants and process engineer (due to training and job title) is frequently asked to examine the "big picture" in a production/operations environment. This can be a formal request for a diagnostic review or a vague request from top management to see what's wrong or what kind of improvements can be done with production/operations.

Batching is the process of measuring concrete mix ingre-dients by either mass or volume and introducing them into the mixer. To produce concrete of uniform quality the ingredients must be measured accurately for each batch. Most specifiions require that batching be done by mass rather than by volume (ASTM C 94 or AASHTO M 157).

## Cement: Materials and manufacturing process
• Chalk is porous and often has high moisture content that leads it to its use in the 'semi-dry/wet' manufacturing process of making cement. This particular process represents some 16% of total production. Shale • Shale is a pure sedimentary rock made of very fine silt clay and quarz. Shale falls in the egory of mudstones.
