## CHAPTER THREE Coal
Coal-Fired Power Plant Designs Systems and Components Conventional coal EGUs have various designs and configurations but have similar processes. First units receive process and combust coal to produce steam. This steam drives a turbine generator to produce electricity that is fed into the electricity transmission system.

## Process Optimization Guidance for Reducing Mercury 
The Process Optimization Guidance (POG) summarizes mercury emission reduction practices applicable to coal-fired power plants. Mercury emissions from combustion of coal in power plants and industrial boilers constituted approximately 26 per cent of the global anthropogenic emissions of mercury in 2005.

## COAL EXTRACTION AND PROCESSING 
the process of subsurface coal extraction and thermal coal processing. Purpose Coal is used for its potential heat energy when burned and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity in power plants. To to generate electricity coal is first burned inside a power plant and the heat generated by the coal is then used to heat water.

## FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT of COAL INTEGRATED GASIFICATION 
In India coal plays a very important role for power generation. Essentially all the power generated from coal is based on the PC (pulverized coal) plant. As both the economy and power demand in India have grown rapidly in recent years the Government of India is looking for alternatives to the PC plant to use coal more efficiently and cleanly.
